/**
 * @title SafeBEP20
 * @dev Wrappers around BEP20 operations that throw on failure (when the token
 * contract returns false). Tokens that return no value (and instead revert or
 * throw on failure) are also supported, non-reverting calls are assumed to be
 * successful.
 * To use this library you can add a `using SafeBEP20 for IBEP20;` statement to your contract,
 * which allows you to call the safe operations as `token.safeTransfer(...)`, etc.
