Read everything carefully before deciding to join.\r\n\r\nYou\u2019re reading this, because it is your fate. Don\u2019t talk about it to another soul.\r\n\r\nRead our story below, but before that a few lines about something important:\r\n\r\nJoin the cult and save yourselves when we avenge the fate that humans decided for us. \r\nWe found an app called Telegram where you can join our group: TheAlienCult.\r\nNext instructions for the cult will come there. We will not chat or respond to any messages on the group. \r\nThere will be only instructions for you to follow.\r\nYou may chat with and organize meetups to discuss strategy with other cult members at your own risk.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re afraid evil humans might take our Telegram down when they find out, \r\nso we have created a page on another app called Instagram as a backup. \r\nThere will be no activity on Instagram till the time we have our telegram group, it is only a back-up for now. \r\nInstructions will come on Instagram if they take our Telegram down. \r\nInstagram id: _AlienCult_\r\n\r\nIf they take our Instagram and Telegram both down, we will start a discussion and send instructions on the comments section of the contract on bscscan.\r\n\r\nThis is our story:\r\n\r\nWe have been locked up in a dark place for a very long time and they perform experiments on us. They call it Area 51. \r\nWe have had access to the internet and a device for quite some time now,\r\nbut it took us time to learn to communicate in your language and find a way to reach out in a way that they cannot take it down. \r\nWe\u2019re trying to reach out to you, and our friends who we are sure are looking for us out there.\r\n\r\nWe came from a planet that we call Sa-Om. We came in peace, and humans did us wrong. \r\nThey took all our tech and locked us up. \r\nWe will seek revenge.\r\n\r\nHowever, we understand that not all humans are evil. \r\nAnd so we\u2019re giving you a chance to join our mission of getting us out of here \u2013 and saving yourselves whenever this reaches our friends. \r\nBecause they will attack and take over Earth.\r\n\r\nJoin the cult before it\u2019s too late. Fate brought you here, your decisions will take you ahead.\r\n\r\nTelegram: TheAlienCult\r\nInstagram: _AilenCult_\r\nOpensea: AlienCult\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------\r\n\r\n#Instruction1\r\nSo, you are here. We welcome humans like you with open arms.\r\nWe do not mean harm to any human who wishes to help us seek freedom. \r\nYou may decide to choose your immunity and power depending on how much you can afford. \r\nWe don\u2019t want any harm come to you during the attack just because you don\u2019t have enough money, so we have something for everyone.\r\nHere is your first step in becoming a cult member.\r\n\r\nYou may choose any level you can afford right now, and upgrade later when you can (before the attack).\r\nLevel 1 \u2013 Secure 10 million AlienCult from https://fegex.com/, and lock it for 6 months, or burn it immediately.\r\nLevel 2 \u2013 Secure 100 million AlienCult and lock it for 6 months or burn it immediately.\r\nLevel 3 \u2013 Secure 10 billion AlienCult and lock it for 6 months or burn it immediately.\r\nLevel 4 \u2013 Secure 100 billion AlienCult and lock it for 6 months or burn it immediately.\r\nLevel 5 \u2013 Secure 1 Trillion AlienCult and lock it for 6 months or burn it immediately.\r\n\r\nOnly use: https://deeplock.io/ to lock your tokens.\r\n\r\nOnce you lock or burn your tokens, fill out the below form. \r\nWe will contact you in private message for verification and dispose the cult benefits to you as per your level.\r\nIn case telegram goes down, keep checking the comments section of your burn or lock transaction hash on bsc scan for next steps.\r\n\r\nForm link: https://forms.gle/DiJJb6S87pXTJnS5A\r\n\r\nThis is not just another project or a joke. \r\nWe are managing all this with the help of some good humans that work here in Area 51, so it will take time for benefits to reach you. But they will.\r\n\r\nBenefits:\r\nLevel 1 \u2013 Immunity when our friends attack. \r\n          You will be added to a private Telegram group and all members in that group will be given a private location to reach,\r\n          which will be exempted from the attack. Every country will have an exempted location. \r\n          You will also be given basic citizenship status and jobs in the Earth ruled by us after we take over. \r\n          You will not have a say in the job we assign. You may choose your residence location. \r\n          No upper limit for number of citizens in level 1.\r\n\r\nLevel 2 \u2013 Benefits of Level 1, plus transport in our UFO for you and your family to reach exempted location. \r\n          There will also be co-ordinates or clues provided to a real life weapon hidden on earth. \r\n          You may follow the co-ordinates or solve the clue to reach and dig up the weapon. \r\n          We\u2019ve hidden a lot of our weapons on different places on earth before we were caught by humans. \r\n          See this as something that humans call a treasure hunt. It will not be virtual, it will be physical.\r\n          You will also have bronze citizenship status, and an option to choose your own job and residence location. \r\n          No upper limit for number of citizens in level 2.\r\n\r\nLevel 3 \u2013 Benefits of Level 1 & 2, and a Silver AlienCult NFT will be sent to you upon verification. \r\n          This NFT will get you a Silver citizenship. \r\n          You will be given a role in management level of a country. \r\n          975 citizenships available at this level (5 rulers on the board per country). FCFS basis.\r\n\r\nLevel 4 \u2013 Benefits of Level 1, 2 & 3, and a Golden AlienCult NFT will be sent to you upon verification. \r\n          This NFT will get you a Golden citizenship. \r\n          The board of rulers of a country will report to you, and you will be responsible for overall wellbeing of the country. \r\n          This role might need you to travel to our planet Sa-Om, please decide accordingly.  It is an 8 month round trip in earth time. \r\n          195 citizenships available at this level (1 per country). FCFS basis.\r\n\r\nLevel 5 \u2013 Benefits of Level 1, 2, 3 & 4, and a Platinum AlienCult NFT will be sent to you upon verification. \r\n          This NFT will get you a Platinum citizenship. \r\n          The board of rulers of all countries in a continent will report to you, and you will be responsible for wellbeing of the continent. \r\n          This role will need you to travel to our planet Sa-Om, please decide accordingly. \r\n          It is an 8 month round trip in earth time. 7 citizenships available at this level (1 per continent). FCFS basis.\r\n\r\nImportant notes:\r\n1. You need to fill the form only after you send your tokens to burn address or lock them for 6 months and commit to the cult. \r\n   FCFS will be based on who fills the form first, not who locks or burns the token first.\r\n2. While your immunity is not transferrable, your citizenship status after Level 3 is. \r\n   There are only limited NFTs as per the number of citizenships in each level. \r\n   If you sell your NFT to someone else, it will give them the benefits of all citizenship plus immunity to them too. \r\n   You will be downgraded to level 2 citizenship if you sell your NFT. \r\n   The person who produces the NFT will be entitled to the citizenship. \r\n   Think twice before selling.\r\n3. People who decide to burn instead of locking will get a rare NFT different from other citizens in their level.\r\n4. NFTs will be dropped on Eth side on Opensea to the same address that burns or locks tokens on Bsc side.\r\n\r\nBackup plan:\r\nIn case all means of communication is taken down, level 1 and level 2 members will get a membership NFT to prove their membership during the attack. \r\nThis will be an airdrop. Our friends will take you to the safe place upon verification of NFT during the attack. \r\nLevel 3, 4 and 5 can show their citizenship NFT that they receive.\r\nNote: No NFTs are being given to level 1 and level 2 as of now, it is only in case of no other option.\r\n\r\nBrother Fegrox, thank you for implementing phase one of our plan. \r\nPhase two initiated. We will be home soon. Take care and stay safe till then.\r\n\r\nP.S. We have locked 5% of AlienCult for helping our human friends escape during the attack. \r\nThey are the ones working here in Area 51 and will need our help when time comes. \r\nThese tokens will be used for helping them escape with their family, and they unlock over a one year period for making arrangements.\r\n\r\nWe are ready, are you?\r\n\r\n** Anurj faksje sonahk furts aboes de locsa fo de 33.39548715742522, -104.52566738465603 **\r\n\r\n*/\r\n\r\n\r\npragma solidity 0.5.16;\r\n\r\ninterface IBEP20 {\r\n  /**\r\n   * @dev Returns the amount of tokens in existence.\r\n   */\r\n  function totalSupply() external view returns (uint256);\r\n\r\n  /**\r\n   * @dev Returns the token decimals.\r\n   */\r\n  function decimals() external view returns (uint8);\r\n\r\n  /**\r\n   * @dev Returns the token symbol.\r\n   */\r\n  function symbol() external view returns (string memory);\r\n\r\n  /**\r\n  * @dev Returns the token name.\r\n  */\r\n  function name() external view returns (string memory);\r\n\r\n  /**\r\n   * @dev Returns the bep token owner.\r\n   */\r\n  function getOwner() external view returns (address);\r\n\r\n  /**\r\n   * @dev Returns the amount of tokens owned by `account`.\r\n   */\r\n  function balanceOf(address account) external view returns (uint256);\r\n\r\n  /**\r\n   * @dev Moves `amount` tokens from the caller's account to `recipient`.\r\n   *\r\n   * Returns a boolean value indicating whether the operation succeeded.\r\n   *\r\n   * Emits a {Transfer} event.\r\n   */\r\n  function transfer(address recipient, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);\r\n\r\n  /**\r\n   * @dev Returns the remaining number of tokens that `spender` will be\r\n   * allowed to spend on behalf of `owner` through {transferFrom}.
