 * @title OwnableUpgradeable

 * an account (an owner) that can be granted exclusive access to specific
 * functions.
 *
 * By default, the owner account will be the one that deploys the contract.
 * This can later be changed through a two-step process:
 * {transferOwnership, claimOwnership}
 *
 * The contract is used through inheritance. It will make available the modifier
 * `onlyOwner`, which can be applied to functions to restrict their use to the
 * owner.
