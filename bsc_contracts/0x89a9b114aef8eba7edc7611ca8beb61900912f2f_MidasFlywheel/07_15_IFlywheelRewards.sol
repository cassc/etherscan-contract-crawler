/**
 @title Rewards Module for Flywheel
 @notice Flywheel is a general framework for managing token incentives.
         It takes reward streams to various *strategies* such as staking LP tokens and divides them among *users* of those strategies.

         The Rewards module is responsible for:
         * determining the ongoing reward amounts to entire strategies (core handles the logic for dividing among users)
         * actually holding rewards that are yet to be claimed

         The reward stream can follow arbitrary logic as long as the amount of rewards passed to flywheel core has been sent to this contract.

         Different module strategies include:
         * a static reward rate per second
         * a decaying reward rate
         * a dynamic just-in-time reward stream
         * liquid governance reward delegation (Curve Gauge style)

         SECURITY NOTE: The rewards strategy should be smooth and continuous, to prevent gaming the reward distribution by frontrunning.
