A postcapitalism must be built \\\\\\\\u2018inside\\\\\\\\u2019 capitalism and find its own way to emerge \\\\\\\\u2018out of\\\\\\\\u2019 capitalism. Our approach combines the radical rupture of bitcoin with the integration of CoFi and adds to them the agenda of expressing different collectively-defined means of defining and measuring value, to build an open, new economic space. Building a whole economy represents a profound change in direction for cryptodesign. We call it the Economic Space Protocol.[10] The Economic Space Protocol is the language that network participants, through their agents,[11] use to interact, program and operate an economic space. These social and economic interactions are of the participants\\\\\\\\u2019 own determination, but not in circumstances of their own choosing. It is important to highlight that the existence of the network and its protocols is the foundation of interactions between participants: they interact _through_ the network.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[10] See L\\\\\\\\u00F3pez, J. \\\\\\\\u2018Economic performance: The Economic Space Protocol.\\\\\\\\u2019 http://economicperformance.manifold.one.

In this context, they can be thought of as individuals or self-organized groups of individuals under a singular network identity.\\\");\\n       units.push(\\\"But nor is the network imposed on participants. Although an agent ensures adherence to the protocol, when the protocols are designed the \\\\\\\\u2018right\\\\\\\\u2019 way, participants operate in an open and coordinated space where they can collectively assert sovereignty over the network; not via a central authority, but via distributed network governance. Choice is individual and sovereignty is collective. The objective of design is to enable a process of sovereignty that sees participant decisions incentivized to enhance shared goals. The effect would be to bring the collective and each participant into alignment.\\\");\\n       units.push(\\\"Framed this way, the economy is a programmable, designable medium: not in a mechanistic, reductionist sense of guaranteed processes and outcomes, but in the sense that how the economy works and its key conventions \\\\\\\\u2013 the kind of relations, interactions, agents, incentives and values the network operates under \\\\\\\\u2013 can become simultaneously an automation space and a design space, continuously open to its participants. We started this chapter with the contention that crypto developments have not yet given focus to new ways of producing, or what we prefer to call \\\\\\\\u2018performances.\\\\\\\\u2019[12] Performances involve processes of new value creation. Understood more broadly than \\\\\\\\u2018production,\\\\\\\\u2019 performances can focus on issues of social meaning, shared risk taking, and affect. It is important, therefore, that our initial approach to the Economic Space Protocol centers on performances. The Economic Space Protocol sets out three critical features of performances:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[12] The distinctive meaning of a \\\\\\\\u2018performance,\\\\\\\\u2019 and its deeper significance, is elaborated in Chapter 4.\\\");\\n       units.push(\\\"_New forms of economic participation._ Capitalism produces one form of incentives, one form of ownership, one money system and one stream of value.[13] The Economic Space Protocol enables a different stream of value, with different incentives, ownership and tokens. Agents in the network design their own performance expressions, including the internal relations of performing and the social outcomes they claim for their outputs.[14] These relations, as well as the outcomes of a performance will be evaluated by the network as contributions to the creation of new economic value. The network is not specifying exactly how \\\\\\\\u2018postcapitalist production\\\\\\\\u2019 should be organized, but when protocols are not designed around extractive class relations, the most suitable forms of performance relations are created by agents themselves.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[13] Other forms of incentives, ownership and money do indeed exist within society but our point here is that capitalist incentives etc. are hegemonic and are expanding their reach into facets of daily life and social relations once seen as outside the economy.\\\\\\\\n [14] The public policy literature discussed in Appendix 4.1 highlights the importance of the difference between outputs and the outcomes, or effects, of those outputs. Public policy is clearly more concerned to produce outcomes more than just outputs. Adopting the same framing, our use of the terms is that performances produce outputs but the network attributes value (it validates output) based on social outcomes. However, as will become apparent, it is necessary that ledgers record outputs, but these are always validated outputs (that is, they are recognized as having produced certain outcomes). When we describe the social contribution of performances, the focus will be on outcomes; when we describe the ledger processes, the focus will be on outputs, but the latter always presumes network-validated outcomes. This process is described in Chapter 4.\\\");\\n       units.push(\\\"_Reciprocal staking._ All agents invest in other agents. They invest not from a store of \\\\\\\\u2018money,\\\\\\\\u2019 but by giving up stake in themselves. Hence staking is reciprocal. The network will involve an evolving web of connections of stake ownership, creating the conditions for a network commons.[15] Agents therefore have financial, strategic and emotional skin-in-the-game across the network. Individual agents want their performances \\\\\\\\u2013 their offers to the network \\\\\\\\u2013 to be evaluated by the network as to whether they are deemed to create value for the network, and this evaluation determines the rewards for staking (\\\\\\\\u2018dividends\\\\\\\\u2019).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[15] The way in which mutual staking forms a commons is addressed in Chapter 6.\\\");\\n       units.push(\\\"_New modes of valuing._ When agents reciprocally stake and make their specific staking decisions on who in the network is creating valuable social output, they are signaling what they believe creates a \\\\\\\\u2018collectively defined value.\\\\\\\\u2019[16] This signaling will be formed into network-generated units of measurement (see Chapter 7), so that agents in the network are participating in both creating value and defining what constitutes a \\\\\\\\u2018collectively defined value.\\\\\\\\u2019\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[16] In the focus on alternative notions of value, staking could be seen as an act of partial or full philanthropy. In that framing, the staker may simply want the performance and its outputs to be realized because they are a \\\\\\\\u2018good cause.\\\\\\\\u2019 The network will indeed collect data on these philanthropic stakings, and there may appear correlations/causations that reveal a wider social benefit attributable to such performances. These performances may indeed find recognition in the network as value-creating, even when this is not the intention of the performing agents. But the network is not defined by philanthropy: it is defined by value creation and returns for value creation, where the distinctive feature is that the products of performances can create collectively defined value even when they create no profit.\\\");\\n       units.push(\\\"These three features are interrelated in ways that will unfold in subsequent chapters. In effect, we have taken the collective values of the commons and designed a way to reconcile them with market relations.\\\");\\n       units.push(\\\"Our goal is to build distributed economic relations that privilege collectively-expressed values and the creation and distribution of outputs (and their outcomes) that comply with, and are motivated by, those values. So the significance of starting with performances is that it gives focus to _shared flows of value creation_, and the incentives to risk in generating those flows, not on the issue of _individual decisions to buy and sell_. This focus is the key to building a network with a collective momentum, rather than being a forum for trading per se.\\\");\\n       units.push(\\\"A NOTE ON TERMINOLOGY\\\");\\n       units.push(\\\"By this point, readers will have already come across some terms that are new, or familiar words being configured in new ways. In a project such as ours, it is always a dilemma whether to invent new terms or to try and wrest familiar terms from their narrow historic framings. We have done some of each, and carefully considered how to get that balance right. To assist readers in this interpretation, we provide a glossary to terminology developed in the Economic Space Agency.[17]\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[17] The ECSA Glossary is available at https://glossary.ecsa.io/.\\\");\\n       units.push(\\\"There are three terms, which have already appeared, that need some degree of clarification at this stage: staking, tokens and value. The clarification here is definitely preliminary, and we will reprise and elaborate these terms on a number of occasions as the analysis develops.\\\");\\n       units.push(\\\"_Staking_. In cryptoeconomics, staking has recently become prevalent, but with multiple different points of emphasis. One use of the term arises in the context of \\\\\\\\u2018proof-of-stake,\\\\\\\\u2019[18] where people stake their holdings of a token as collateral to become validators of ledger transfers of that token. A second form of staking is lending tokens that others may borrow (e.g. for use in derivative trades), generating a speculative yield to ownership. A third is collateralizing (staking) tokens for a loan in a stabletoken, which can then again be invested or staked (and the process rinsed and repeated, many times). These practices led to token markets becoming increasingly leveraged, and susceptible to the price crash that happened in 2022.[19]\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[18] The need to cut energy usage in ordering transactions on a blockchain has seen the system of verification shift rapidly from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake.\\\\\\\\n [19] Staking, in this sense, is often also incentivized by (often absurd) returns in the protocol native token, or in the protocol\\\\\\\\u2019s native token in combination with some other protocol\\\\\\\\u2019s token.\\\");\\n       units.push(\\\"A fourth use of the term staking involves locking tokens to a protocol\\\\\\\\u2019s staking contract in return for certain \\\\\\\\u2018rights.\\\\\\\\u2019[20] As a type, this form of staking is one application of our use of the term. In our analysis, staking involves taking on a financial exposure to the success/failure of another person or group\\\\\\\\u2019s (agent\\\\\\\\u2019s) creation of output. In aggregate, it gives a network a shared exposure to the future. It is a process of investing in new performance, and it generates returns based on the success of that process. Some in cryptoeconomics (e.g. Walden 2020) talk of the importance of intertemporal commitment in an \\\\\\\\u2018ownership economy,\\\\\\\\u2019 and our view broadly aligns with this.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[20] For example, vote-escrowed governance tokens, or some other \\\\\\\\u2018rights,\\\\\\\\u2019 largely depending on the amount and the length of staking time.\\\");\\n       units.push(\\\"_Tokens_. By definition, tokens are an exclusive, transferable and quantifiable set of rights, but in many people\\\\\\\\u2019s initial understanding, they are simply alternatives to the state\\\\\\\\u2019s fiat currency, with bitcoin as the chief referenced challenger. In both cases, these are issued centrally by a third party. The state\\\\\\\\u2019s issuance rests on the reputation of the state; bitcoin\\\\\\\\u2019s on a widespread belief in the blockchain, its finite quantum and its cultural statement. Both are believed (and agreed) to be a store of value; one (for now) deemed \\\\\\\\u2018safe\\\\\\\\u2019; the other volatile, but a store nonetheless.\\\");\\n       units.push(\\\"The tokens we introduce are neither centrally issued nor do they store wealth in themselves: there is no \\\\\\\\u2018money\\\\\\\\u2019 in the conventional sense. Instead, in a distributed network (without a central 3rd party authority), tokens are issued by individuals/collectives (agents) to transfer an exclusive set of rights to an underlying value, be it a good, a service or an asset. Tokens are at the service of a ledger, and the balance on the ledger records the good service or asset being transferred in one direction and a token transferred in the other direction. The question, of course, is what you can do with a token issued by another person. Answering this will take us into details our analysis is not yet ready to reveal but, to give some answer, those tokens are associated with the settlement of credit.[21]\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[21] This issue is addressed in Chapter 7.\\\");\\n       units.push(\\\"_Value._ This concept has two general meanings. One relates to values as an ethical frame (as in personal values). The other relates to value as a quantifiable statement of what something is worth. Those two may overlap significantly (a quantified ethics), but the second concept of value has a meaning as a unit of commensuration (or foundation for establishing equivalence), as in Marx\\\\\\\\u2019s \\\\\\\\u2018labor theory of value.\\\\\\\\u2019 There, the term may be used in relation to the system of value calculation and analysis, or to the quantified worth of a particular thing (the value of/attributed to a cup of coffee, according to the adopted theory of value). We note the importance of the first, ethical meaning but do not discuss it, although we take it as the impulse to frame value theory in a particular way. In our analysis, we use the term value to mean both the abstract system of calculation, and the concrete valuation of particular outputs. However, it needs to be said that theories of value, of all varieties, perform best as indicative of social processes rather than formal calculative systems.\\\");\\n       units.push(\\\"CAPITALIST AND POSTCAPITALIST FINANCE\\\");\\n       units.push(\\\"Earlier in this chapter we gave focus to finance as the frontier of capitalist economic change and from where postcapitalism must develop.
