These should be exposed\\n * in the external API and be unique.

Each role has an associated admin role, and only\\n * accounts that have a role's admin role can call {grantRole} and {revokeRole}.\\n *\\n * By default, the admin role for all roles is `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, which means\\n * that only accounts with this role will be able to grant or revoke other\\n * roles. More complex role relationships can be created by using\\n * {_setRoleAdmin}.\\n *\\n * WARNING: The `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` is also its own admin: it has permission to\\n * grant and revoke this role.
