We have all experience the feeling of Deja Vu and sometimes it’s pleasant however other times we feel uneasy about it.
Guys I had this Deja Vu feeling about launching a coin and it pumping to above 1 million in market cap.
Since I got this feeling I feel Obligated to launch this coin. Guys tax will be 0 since,
I do not want to tax rug you and since I have this feeling about this coin mooning,
I feel that 0 tax is the best way to go about it.
Make sure to use low slip since to avoid front run bots, since its a 0 tax coin.

Déjà vu is a French loanword expressing the feeling that one has lived through the present situation before.
Although some interpret déjà vu in a paranormal context,mainstream scientific approaches reject the explanation of déjà vu as “precognition” or “prophecy”.
It is an anomaly of memory whereby, despite the strong sense of recollection, the time, place, and practical context of the “previous” experience are uncertain or believed to be impossible.

Liquidity will be partially burned at launch and will be fully burned at 100k.
Contract is pre renounced to dead address.
Use low slippage to avoid frontrun bots as this is set to 0 tax.
