 * @dev Contract module that helps prevent reentrant calls to a function.
 *
 * Inheriting from `ReentrancyGuard` will make the {_lock_} modifier
 * available, which can be applied to functions to make sure there are no nested
 * (reentrant) calls to them.
 *
 * Note that because there is a single `_lock_` guard, functions marked as
 * `_lock_` may not call one another. This can be worked around by making
 * those functions `private`, and then adding `external` `_lock_` entry
 * points to them.
 *
 * Also adds a _lockview_ modifier, which doesn't create a lock, but fails
 *   if another _lock_ call is in progress
