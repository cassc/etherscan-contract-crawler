/**
 * @dev This implements a Pre-Mint version of {ERC721} that adds the ability to Pre-Mint
 * all the token ids in the contract as assign an initial owner for each token id.
 *
 * On-chain state for Pre-Mint does not need to be initially stored if Max-Supply is known.
 * Minting is a simple matter of assigning a balance to the pre-mint receiver,
 * and modifying the "read" methods to account for the pre-mint receiver as owner.
 * We use the Consecutive Transfer Method as defined in EIP-2309 to signal inital ownership.
 * Almost everything else remains standard.
 * We also default to the contract "owner" as the pre-mint receiver, but this can be changed.
