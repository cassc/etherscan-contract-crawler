     * This journey began on September 24th, 2021,
     * when the original PunkScapes smart contract went live.
     * The mission was simple: Create "10,000 homes for the CryptoPunks."
     *
     * But as we received more and more love from other communities,
     * it became clear that we wanted to become a HOME FOR EVERYONE.
     * From this realization, we embarked on a mission
     * to build a world centered around that idea.
     *
     * The metadata and art of PunkScapes
     * was originally hosted on the Interplanetary File System (IPFS).
     * But we soon realized, in order to fulfill their true potential,
     * they needed to go fully onchain.
     *
     * As time passed,
     * we felt the weight of our old contract,
     * and knew it was time to move on.
     *
     * So, on the 20th of December,
     * we burned the old world to the ground,
     * leaving behind only ashes and memories.
     * From those ashes, we built a new world,
     * one that would be our home for all time.
     *
     * And thus, the Scapes were created.
     *
     * Welcome home.
