Each 1,000 tokens will\\r\\n* be backed by one, $40k value, NFT domain name, giving an average TNDY token value of $40.\\r\\n* \\r\\n* Whenever TENDY sells an NFT domain name it will use this income to buyback and burn TNDY\\r\\n* tokens on the Uniswap DeFi platform, positively influencing the TNDY token value.\\r\\n* \\r\\n* And, 10% of the TENDY regulated NFT marketplace revenues will be used to buyback and\\r\\n* burn TNDY tokens on the Uniswap DeFi platform, positively influencing the TNDY token value.\\r\\n* \\r\\n* TENDY intends to buyback TNDY tokens with such revenues when the token price is below \\r\\n* NAV, this action is intended to support the established NAV.\\r\\n* \\r\\n* Once the NAV of the TNDY token is aligned with the actual NFT asset value, then TENDY \\r\\n* will deposit the balance of its sales revenue along with a pro rata number of its TNDY \\r\\n* treasury tokens into the Uniswap DeFi liquidity pool, causing the TNDY price to stabilize.\\r\\n* \\r\\n* Periodically, TENDY will update the NAV of the assets backing the TNDY token as market\\r\\n* conditions change and the average value of its NFT domain names rises, or when TENDY purchases\\r\\n* new NFT domains for its portfolio. \\r\\n* \\r\\n* When the TNDY price is higher than the established NAV, then TENDY may sell treasury tokens \\r\\n* into Uniswap, causing the TNDY price to decrease until it reaches equilibrium with the NAV.\\r\\n* Future domain name sales will drive the token price back to NAV and|or be used to stabilize NAV.\\r\\n* \\r\\n*\\r\\n* https://tendy.com/ -- TENDY, LLC\\r\\n*\\r\\n* Address: 221 34th St. #1000, Manhattan Beach, CA 90266, USA\\r\\n* Email: info@tendy.com\\r\\n*\\r\\n* As at 2-September-2021, TENDY, LLC is a US limited liability company registered in Wyoming.\\r\\n*\\r\\n* This is an ERC-20 smart contract for the TNDY token that will be used as one side\\r\\n* of a Uniswap liquidity pool trading pair. This TNDY token has the following properties:\\r\\n*\\r\\n* 1. The number of TNDY tokens from this contract that will be initially added to the \\r\\n*    Uniswap liquidity pool shall be 16,500.

The value of the ETH currency swapped by TENDY shall be equal to 100% of TENDYs actual\\r\\n*    domain name sales revenue, as disclosed on its website from time to time. Each ETH\\r\\n*    swap shall be performed no later than 30 working days after a TENDY domain name sale.\\r\\n* 4. TNDY tokens returned by Uniswap from the buyback/swap of ETH by TENDY shall be burned \\r\\n*    by this smart contract.\\r\\n* 5. This contract shall not be allowed mint any new TNDY tokens, i.e., no dilution.\\r\\n* 6. TENDY, the company, shall initially hold 3,267,000 TNDY tokens on its balance sheet,\\r\\n*    i.e., the TNDY treasury tokens. These tokens may be only be sold by TENDY into Uniswap\\r\\n*    as part of TNDY price stabilization or transferred to the treasury Uniswap liquidity pool, \\r\\n*    along with ETH, for price stability.\\r\\n* 7.
