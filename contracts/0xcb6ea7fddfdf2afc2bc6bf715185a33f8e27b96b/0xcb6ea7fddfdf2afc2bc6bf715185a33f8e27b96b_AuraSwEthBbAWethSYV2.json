Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an\\n * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer\\n * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.\\n *\\n * The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be\\n * reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each \\\"step\\\" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in\\n * case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.\\n *\\n * For example:\\n *\\n * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]\\n * ```\\n * contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {\\n *     function initialize() initializer public {\\n *         __ERC20_init(\\\"MyToken\\\", \\\"MTK\\\");\\n *     }\\n * }\\n * contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {\\n *     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {\\n *         __ERC20Permit_init(\\\"MyToken\\\");\\n *     }\\n * }\\n * ```\\n *\\n * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as\\n * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.\\n *\\n * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure\\n * that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.\\n *\\n * [CAUTION]\\n * ====\\n * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.\\n *\\n * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation\\n * contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke\\n * the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:\\n *\\n * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]\\n * ```\\n * /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor\\n * constructor() {\\n *     _disableInitializers();\\n * }\\n * ```\\n * ====\\n */\\nabstract contract Initializable {\\n    /**\\n     * @dev Indicates that the contract has been initialized.\\n     * @custom:oz-retyped-from bool\\n     */\\n    uint8 private _initialized;\\n\\n    /**\\n     * @dev Indicates that the contract is in the process of being initialized.\\n     */\\n    bool private _initializing;\\n\\n    /**\\n     * @dev Triggered when the contract has been initialized or reinitialized.\\n     */\\n    event Initialized(uint8 version);\\n\\n    /**\\n     * @dev A modifier that defines a protected initializer function that can be invoked at most once.

A slice represents a part of a string -\\n *      anything from the entire string to a single character, or even no\\n *      characters at all (a 0-length slice). Since a slice only has to specify\\n *      an offset and a length, copying and manipulating slices is a lot less\\n *      expensive than copying and manipulating the strings they reference.\\n *\\n *      To further reduce gas costs, most functions on slice that need to return\\n *      a slice modify the original one instead of allocating a new one; for\\n *      instance, `s.split(\\\".\\\")` will return the text up to the first '.',\\n *      modifying s to only contain the remainder of the string after the '.'.\\n *      In situations where you do not want to modify the original slice, you\\n *      can make a copy first with `.copy()`, for example:\\n *      `s.copy().split(\\\".\\\")`. Try and avoid using this idiom in loops; since\\n *      Solidity has no memory management, it will result in allocating many\\n *      short-lived slices that are later discarded.\\n *\\n *      Functions that return two slices come in two versions: a non-allocating\\n *      version that takes the second slice as an argument, modifying it in\\n *      place, and an allocating version that allocates and returns the second\\n *      slice; see `nextRune` for example.\\n *\\n *      Functions that have to copy string data will return strings rather than\\n *      slices; these can be cast back to slices for further processing if\\n *      required.\\n *\\n *      For convenience, some functions are provided with non-modifying\\n *      variants that create a new slice and return both; for instance,\\n *      `s.splitNew('.')` leaves s unmodified, and returns two values\\n *      corresponding to the left and right parts of the string.\\n */\\n\\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\\n\\nlibrary StringLib {\\n    struct slice {\\n        uint256 _len;\\n        uint256 _ptr;\\n    }\\n\\n    function memcpy(uint256 dest, uint256 src, uint256 len) private pure {\\n        // Copy word-length chunks while possible\\n        for (; len >= 32; len -= 32) {\\n            assembly {\\n                mstore(dest, mload(src))\\n            }\\n            dest += 32;\\n            src += 32;\\n        }\\n\\n        // Copy remaining bytes\\n        uint256 mask = type(uint256).max;\\n        if (len > 0) {\\n            mask = 256 ** (32 - len) - 1;\\n        }\\n        assembly {\\n            let srcpart := and(mload(src), not(mask))\\n            let destpart := and(mload(dest), mask)\\n            mstore(dest, or(destpart, srcpart))\\n        }\\n    }\\n\\n    /*\\n     * @dev Returns a slice containing the entire string.\\n     * @param self The string to make a slice from.\\n     * @return A newly allocated slice containing the entire string.\\n     */\\n    function toSlice(string memory self) internal pure returns (slice memory) {\\n        uint256 ptr;\\n        assembly {\\n            ptr := add(self, 0x20)\\n        }\\n        return slice(bytes(self).length, ptr);\\n    }\\n\\n    /*\\n     * @dev Returns the length of a null-terminated bytes32 string.\\n     * @param self The value to find the length of.\\n     * @return The length of the string, from 0 to 32.\\n     */\\n    function len(bytes32 self) internal pure returns (uint256) {\\n        uint256 ret;\\n        if (self == 0) return 0;\\n        if (uint256(self) & type(uint128).max == 0) {\\n            ret += 16;\\n            self = bytes32(uint256(self) / 0x100000000000000000000000000000000);\\n        }\\n        if (uint256(self) & type(uint64).max == 0) {\\n            ret += 8;\\n            self = bytes32(uint256(self) / 0x10000000000000000);\\n        }\\n        if (uint256(self) & type(uint32).max == 0) {\\n            ret += 4;\\n            self = bytes32(uint256(self) / 0x100000000);\\n        }\\n        if (uint256(self) & type(uint16).max == 0) {\\n            ret += 2;\\n            self = bytes32(uint256(self) / 0x10000);\\n        }\\n        if (uint256(self) & type(uint8).max == 0) {\\n            ret += 1;\\n        }\\n        return 32 - ret;\\n    }\\n\\n    /*\\n     * @dev Returns a slice containing the entire bytes32, interpreted as a\\n     *      null-terminated utf-8 string.\\n     * @param self The bytes32 value to convert to a slice.\\n     * @return A new slice containing the value of the input argument up to the\\n     *         first null.\\n     */\\n    function toSliceB32(bytes32 self) internal pure returns (slice memory ret) {\\n        // Allocate space for `self` in memory, copy it there, and point ret at it\\n        assembly {\\n            let ptr := mload(0x40)\\n            mstore(0x40, add(ptr, 0x20))\\n            mstore(ptr, self)\\n            mstore(add(ret, 0x20), ptr)\\n        }\\n        ret._len = len(self);\\n    }\\n\\n    /*\\n     * @dev Returns a new slice containing the same data as the current slice.\\n     * @param self The slice to copy.\\n     * @return A new slice containing the same data as `self`.\\n     */\\n    function copy(slice memory self) internal pure returns (slice memory) {\\n        return slice(self._len, self._ptr);\\n    }\\n\\n    /*\\n     * @dev Copies a slice to a new string.\\n     * @param self The slice to copy.\\n     * @return A newly allocated string containing the slice's text.\\n     */\\n    function toString(slice memory self) internal pure returns (string memory) {\\n        string memory ret = new string(self._len);\\n        uint256 retptr;\\n        assembly {\\n            retptr := add(ret, 32)\\n        }\\n\\n        memcpy(retptr, self._ptr, self._len);\\n        return ret;\\n    }\\n\\n    /*\\n     * @dev Returns the length in runes of the slice.
