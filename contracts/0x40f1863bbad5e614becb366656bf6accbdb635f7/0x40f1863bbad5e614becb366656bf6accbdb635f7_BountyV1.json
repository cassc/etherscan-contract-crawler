Bounties also must\\n    remain open until any submission to the bounty has been approved or rejected. Once a bounty is\\n    closed, it cannot be reopened. If a funder closes their bounty, they receive the amount of the\\n    bounty back. (Bounty funders can receive a maximum of 100% of their initial funding back. if\\n    there is excess funding from rejected submissions, it is accrued as fees.)\\n\\n    The contract owner sets the initial submission stake, maker fee, and taker fee.\\n\\n    A maker fee is charged when a bounty is funded. A taker fee is charged when a submission is\\n    paid out. These fees are in basis points, e.g. 100 basis points = 1%. Fees are disbursed at the\\n    discretion of the owner. A fraction of fees are burned, and the rest are withdrawn to an\\n    address set at contract creation and changeable by the owner.\\n\\n    If a submission is approved, the submitter receives the bounty amount plus their stake back,\\n    less a taker fee. If a submission is rejected, the submitter does NOT receive their stake back,\\n    and the bounty amount increases by the amount staked. Only one submission may be active for a\\n    given bounty at a time.\\n\\n    Delivery of the information corresponding to the accepted submission to the funder is handled\\n    off-chain.\\n */\\ncontract BountyV1 is Ownable {\\n    address private immutable _arkm;\\n\\n    uint256 private _submissionStake;\\n    uint256 private _makerFee;\\n    uint256 private _takerFee;\\n    bool    private _acceptingBounties;\\n    uint256 private _accruedFees;\\n    address private _feeReceiverAddress;\\n\\n    uint64 private immutable _bountyDuration;\\n\\n    uint64  private constant _MAX_BPS = 10000;\\n\\n    /// @dev Bounty ID --> Bounty\\n    mapping(uint256 => Bounty) private _bounties;\\n\\n    /// @dev Bounty ID --> Submission.
