/**
 * @dev This module allows Pools to access historical pricing information.
 *
 * It uses a 1024 long circular buffer to store past data, where the data within each sample is the result of
 * accumulating live data for no more than two minutes. Therefore, assuming the worst case scenario where new data is
 * updated in every single block, the oldest samples in the buffer (and therefore largest queryable period) will
 * be slightly over 34 hours old.
 *
 * Usage of this module requires the caller to keep track of two variables: the latest circular buffer index, and the
 * timestamp when the index last changed.
