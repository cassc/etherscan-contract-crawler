There was once a man named Mr. Rekt. He was a big fan of cryptocurrency and was always looking for the next 1000X.he invested all of his savings into a new coin called Mr F was here he thought it was going to be the next Bitcoin. Unfortunately, the coin's value plummeted, and Mr. Rekt lost all of his money so he did the next right thing and created MR REKT but instead of being untruthful about the token he was the most transparent dev the space has ever seen and created what Mr F was here was supposed to be.
