deployed\r\n * behind a proxy. Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an\r\n * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer\r\n * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.\r\n *\r\n * The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be\r\n * reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each \"step\" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in\r\n * case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.\r\n *\r\n * For example:\r\n *\r\n * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]\r\n * ```solidity\r\n * contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {\r\n *     function initialize() initializer public {\r\n *         __ERC20_init(\"MyToken\", \"MTK\");\r\n *     }\r\n * }\r\n *\r\n * contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {\r\n *     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {\r\n *         __ERC20Permit_init(\"MyToken\");\r\n *     }\r\n * }\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as\r\n * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.\r\n *\r\n * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure\r\n * that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.\r\n *\r\n * [CAUTION]\r\n * ====\r\n * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.\r\n *\r\n * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation\r\n * contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke\r\n * the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:\r\n *\r\n * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]\r\n * ```\r\n * /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor\r\n * constructor() {\r\n *     _disableInitializers();\r\n * }\r\n * ```\r\n * ====\r\n */\r\nabstract contract Initializable {\r\n    /**\r\n     * @dev Indicates that the contract has been initialized.\r\n     * @custom:oz-retyped-from bool\r\n     */\r\n    uint8 private _initialized;\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * @dev Indicates that the contract is in the process of being initialized.\r\n     */\r\n    bool private _initializing;\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * @dev Triggered when the contract has been initialized or reinitialized.\r\n     */\r\n    event Initialized(uint8 version);\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * @dev A modifier that defines a protected initializer function that can be invoked at most once.
