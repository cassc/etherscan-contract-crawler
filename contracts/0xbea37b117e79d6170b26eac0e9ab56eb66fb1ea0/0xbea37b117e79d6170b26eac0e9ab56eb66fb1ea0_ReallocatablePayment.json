Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an\r\n * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer\r\n * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.\r\n *\r\n * The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be\r\n * reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each \"step\" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in\r\n * case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.\r\n *\r\n * For example:\r\n *\r\n * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]\r\n * ```\r\n * contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {\r\n *     function initialize() initializer public {\r\n *         __ERC20_init(\"MyToken\", \"MTK\");\r\n *     }\r\n * }\r\n * contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {\r\n *     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {\r\n *         __ERC20Permit_init(\"MyToken\");\r\n *     }\r\n * }\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as\r\n * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.\r\n *\r\n * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure\r\n * that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.\r\n *\r\n * [CAUTION]\r\n * ====\r\n * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.\r\n *\r\n * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation\r\n * contract, which may impact the proxy.

This pattern implies two\r\n * things that go hand in hand:\r\n *\r\n * 1. If any account other than the admin calls the proxy, the call will be forwarded to the implementation, even if\r\n * that call matches one of the admin functions exposed by the proxy itself.\r\n * 2. If the admin calls the proxy, it can access the admin functions, but its calls will never be forwarded to the\r\n * implementation. If the admin tries to call a function on the implementation it will fail with an error that says\r\n * \"admin cannot fallback to proxy target\".\r\n *\r\n * These properties mean that the admin account can only be used for admin actions like upgrading the proxy or changing\r\n * the admin, so it's best if it's a dedicated account that is not used for anything else. This will avoid headaches due\r\n * to sudden errors when trying to call a function from the proxy implementation.\r\n *\r\n * Our recommendation is for the dedicated account to be an instance of the {ProxyAdmin} contract. If set up this way,\r\n * you should think of the `ProxyAdmin` instance as the real administrative interface of your proxy.\r\n *\r\n * NOTE: The real interface of this proxy is that defined in `ITransparentUpgradeableProxy`. This contract does not\r\n * inherit from that interface, and instead the admin functions are implicitly implemented using a custom dispatch\r\n * mechanism in `_fallback`. Consequently, the compiler will not produce an ABI for this contract. This is necessary to\r\n * fully implement transparency without decoding reverts caused by selector clashes between the proxy and the\r\n * implementation.\r\n *\r\n * WARNING: It is not recommended to extend this contract to add additional external functions. If you do so, the compiler\r\n * will not check that there are no selector conflicts, due to the note above. A selector clash between any new function\r\n * and the functions declared in {ITransparentUpgradeableProxy} will be resolved in favor of the new one.
