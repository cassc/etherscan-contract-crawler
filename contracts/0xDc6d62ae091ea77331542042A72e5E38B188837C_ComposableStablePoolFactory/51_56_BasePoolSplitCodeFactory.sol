/**
 * @notice Base contract for Pool factories.
 *
 * Pools are deployed from factories to allow third parties to reason about them. Unknown Pools may have arbitrary
 * logic: being able to assert that a Pool's behavior follows certain rules (those imposed by the contracts created by
 * the factory) is very powerful.
 *
 * @dev By using the split code mechanism, we can deploy Pools with creation code so large that a regular factory
 * contract would not be able to store it.
 *
 * Since we expect to release new versions of pool types regularly - and the blockchain is forever - versioning will
 * become increasingly important. Governance can deprecate a factory by calling `disable`, which will permanently
 * prevent the creation of any future pools from the factory.
