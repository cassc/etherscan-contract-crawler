/* @notice Standard interface for a permit oracle to be used by a permissioned pool. 
 * 
 * @dev For pools under their control permit oracles have the ability to approve or deny
 *      pool initialization, swaps, mints and burns for all liquidity types (ambient,
 *      concentrated and knockout). 
 * 
 *      Note that permit oracles do *not* have the ability to restrict claims or recovers 
 *      on post-knockout liquidity. An order is eligible to be claimed/recovered only after
 *      its liquidity has been knocked out of the curve, and is no longer active. Since a
 *      no longer active order does not affect the liquidity or state of the curve, permit
 *      oracles have no economic reason to restrict knockout claims/recovers. */
