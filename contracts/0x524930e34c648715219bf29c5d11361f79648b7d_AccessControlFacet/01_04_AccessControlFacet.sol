/// applications may benefit from on-chain enumerability, for those cases see
/// {AccessControlEnumerable}.
///
/// Roles are referred to by their `bytes32` identifier. These should be exposed

/// ```
/// bytes32 public constant MANAGER_ROLE = keccak256("MANAGER_ROLE");
/// ```
///
/// Roles can be used to represent a set of permissions. To restrict access to a
/// function call, use add the access at the facet setup:
///
/// ```
/// selectors[1] = FunctionSelector(
///     RoyaltyFacet.setTokenRoyalty.selector,
///     adminAccess()
/// );
/// ```
///
/// Roles can be granted and revoked dynamically via the {grantRole} and
/// {revokeRole} functions. Each role has an associated admin role, and only
/// accounts that have a role's admin role can call {grantRole} and {revokeRole}.

/// that only accounts with this role will be able to grant or revoke other

/// {_setRoleAdmin}.
///
/// WARNING: The `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` is also its own admin: it has permission to
