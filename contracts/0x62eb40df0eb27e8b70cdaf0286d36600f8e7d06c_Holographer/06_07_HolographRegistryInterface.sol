 its contribution or any derivative works that you create.
 B) Patent Grant- Subject to the terms of this license,
 including the license conditions and limitations in section 3,
 each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide,

 E) The software is licensed “as-is.” You bear all risks of
 using it. The contributors give no express warranties,
 guarantees, or conditions. You may have additional consumer
