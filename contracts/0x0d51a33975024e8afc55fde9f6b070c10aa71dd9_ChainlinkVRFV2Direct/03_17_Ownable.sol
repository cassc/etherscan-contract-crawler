/**
 * @title Abstract ownable contract that can be inherited by other contracts
 * @notice Contract module which provides a basic access control mechanism, where
 * there is an account (an owner) that can be granted exclusive access to
 * specific functions.
 *
 * The `owner` is first set by passing the address of the `initialOwner` to the Ownable constructor.
 *
 * The owner account can be transferred through a two steps process:
 *      1. The current `owner` calls {transferOwnership} to set a `pendingOwner`
 *      2. The `pendingOwner` calls {claimOwnership} to accept the ownership transfer
 *
 * This module is used through inheritance. It will make available the modifier
 * `onlyOwner`, which can be applied to your functions to restrict their use to the owner.
