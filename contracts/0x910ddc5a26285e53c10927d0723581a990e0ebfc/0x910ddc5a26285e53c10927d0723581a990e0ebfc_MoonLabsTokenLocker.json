Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an\\n * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer\\n * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.\\n *\\n * The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be\\n * reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each \\\"step\\\" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in\\n * case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.\\n *\\n * For example:\\n *\\n * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]\\n * ```\\n * contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {\\n *     function initialize() initializer public {\\n *         __ERC20_init(\\\"MyToken\\\", \\\"MTK\\\");\\n *     }\\n * }\\n * contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {\\n *     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {\\n *         __ERC20Permit_init(\\\"MyToken\\\");\\n *     }\\n * }\\n * ```\\n *\\n * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as\\n * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.\\n *\\n * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure\\n * that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.\\n *\\n * [CAUTION]\\n * ====\\n * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.\\n *\\n * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation\\n * contract, which may impact the proxy.

token locks for ERC20 tokens. Lock owners may change withdrawn address, extend, transfer, add to,\\n * and split locks. The withdrawal address can withdraw tokens from the lock but does not have any administrative powers over the lock itself. Lock owners may NOT unlock\\n * tokens prematurely for whatever reason. Lock creators may choose to create standard or linear locks. Tokens locked in this contract remain locked until their respective\\n * unlock date without ANY exceptions. This contract is not suited to handle rebasing tokens or tokens in which a wallet's supply changes based on total supply.\\n */\\n\\npragma solidity 0.8.17;\\n\\nimport \\\"@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol\\\";\\nimport \\\"@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/utils/math/MathUpgradeable.sol\\\";\\nimport \\\"@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/access/OwnableUpgradeable.sol\\\";\\nimport \\\"@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/token/ERC20/IERC20Upgradeable.sol\\\";\\nimport \\\"@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20Upgradeable.sol\\\";\\nimport \\\"@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/security/ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable.sol\\\";\\nimport \\\"./IDEXRouter.sol\\\";\\n\\ninterface IMoonLabsReferral {\\n    function checkIfActive(string calldata code) external view returns (bool);\\n\\n    function getAddressByCode(\\n        string memory code\\n    ) external view returns (address);\\n\\n    function addRewardsEarned(string calldata code, uint commission) external;\\n}\\n\\ninterface IMoonLabsWhitelist {\\n    function getIsWhitelisted(\\n        address _address,\\n        bool pair\\n    ) external view returns (bool);\\n}\\n\\ncontract MoonLabsTokenLocker is\\n    Initializable,\\n    OwnableUpgradeable,\\n    ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable\\n{\\n    using SafeERC20Upgradeable for IERC20Upgradeable;\\n\\n    function initialize(\\n        address _mlabToken,\\n        address _feeCollector,\\n        address referralAddress,\\n        address whitelistAddress,\\n        address routerAddress\\n    ) public initializer {\\n        __Ownable_init();\\n        mlabToken = IERC20Upgradeable(_mlabToken);\\n        feeCollector = _feeCollector;\\n        referralContract = IMoonLabsReferral(referralAddress);\\n        whitelistContract = IMoonLabsWhitelist(whitelistAddress);\\n        routerContract = IDEXRouter(routerAddress);\\n        ethLockPrice = .008 ether;\\n        ethSplitPrice = .004 ether;\\n        ethRelockPrice = .004 ether;\\n        burnThreshold = .25 ether;\\n        codeDiscount = 10;\\n        burnPercent = 30;\\n        percentLockPrice = 30;\\n        percentSplitPrice = 15;\\n        percentRelockPrice = 15;\\n        mlabDiscountPercent = 20;\\n        nonce = 0;\\n    }\\n\\n    /*|| === STATE VARIABLES === ||*/\\n    uint public ethLockPrice;
