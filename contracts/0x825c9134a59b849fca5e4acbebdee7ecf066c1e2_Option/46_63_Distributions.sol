 * @author DeOrderBook
 * @custom:license Copyright (c) DeOrderBook, 2023 â€” All Rights Reserved
 * @notice This contract manages different types of fees and their distributions. It is responsible for
 *         defining fee ratios and their allocations. It is upgradeable and only the contract owner has
 *         the permission to change these values. The types of fees include Entry, Exercise, Withdraw,
 *         Redeem, and HODL Withdraw fees. It also manages the ratio of Bullet to Reward and the
 *         distributions of these fees and bullet rewards.
 * @dev This contact uses the concept of "ratio" for managing fee ratios and uses an array of Distribution structs for allocating these fees. The
 *      Distribution struct has two properties: percentage and recipient's address. The contract emits
 *      various events when fee ratios or distributions are changed.
