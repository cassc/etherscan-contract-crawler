/** 
    Purpose of ShibBurnLottery is to burn SHIB tokens through Shib Burn Portal, which in exchange
    returns burntSHIB. When tokens get burned, this contract randomly selects addresses that will
    receive the burntSHIB. Additionaly it can select some more addresses that will receive special
    rewards manualy from the Owner. This can be NFTs / project tokens or other.

    When participating in lottery, user specifies the amount of tokens that he wishes to participate
    with. The amount is directly corelated to chance of winning.
    If user does not have SHIB tokens, he can also execute "buyAndParticipate", which uses ShibaSwap
    to swap ETH to SHIB.

    Example reward distribution:

    n = number of winners = 3
    i = winner position (eg. 1 = 1st place, 2 = 2nd place)
    a = amount of reward in this lottery = 100
    ap = amount already paid out in this lottery
    Formula:
    (a - ap / (n + 2 - i)) * 2

    1st place:
    amount1 = (a / (n + 2 - i)) * 2;
    amount1 = (100 / (3 + 2 - 1) * 2)
    amount1 = 50

    2nd place:
    amount2 = ((a - amount1) / (n + 2 - i)) * 2
    amount2 = ((100 - 50) / (3 + 2 - 2)) * 2
    amount2 = 33

    3rd place:
    amount3 = ((a - amount1 - amount2) / (n + 2 - i)) * 2
    amount3 = ((100 - 50 - 33) / (3 + 2 - 3)) * 2
