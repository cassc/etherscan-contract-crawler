SOULSIDE METAVERSE TOKEN
We are Soulside, a Berlin-based Startup creating a 3D Social Media giving people space for expression, for creativity, and 
for fun. We want to place our users at the center of our platform and through technology enable them to interact & discover 
who themselves and the others are. We want to help people and improve their relationship with others, with themselves but 
also with digital social media. 
Vision
Our Vision With this, users can now also earn money, while spending time on our platform - asides the benefit of a 
social media which has creativity in its primary communication. Every body on Soulside shares their feelings, thoughts 
and creations. We believe in a future where life, work, education, shopping and fun become one in a digital world. A better, 
more beautiful world. We believe in the positivity of people, the positivity of technological and evolutionary developments and 
of value-driven lifestyles. We believe in empowering our users and customers & providing with economical opportunities and 
personal growth.
Mission
Our mission is to give those who cannot express themselves on classical social media the tools to express themselves 
without the fear of being judged and with a real opportunity to share who they truly are. Incorporated in a 3D environment, 
we display and offer people a creative, funny, and well-being social media app. At Soulside, we want to build a culturally 
responsible tech company that values individuality, privacy, and the data of our users. We have designed the Soulside 
platform to give our users power over their virtual profile. We aim to be a positive member of the communities that we 
help flourish. Soulside is for every individual, every character, every personality. 
Soulside Metaverse App
The Project started in January 2021 to build and disrupt the crypto industry with the help of blockchain solution 
integration. Available in Playstore and Appstore! Soulside is a soulful and positive alternative to the usual social 
media apps that let you create 3D posts. Our brain perceives the world in 3D, now there is a brain-friendly 3D 
social media. We focus on positivity and personal values. Normally you have a screen, on Soulside you have 
4 walls and the space in between. 

What can I do on Soulside? 
CREATE 
Design your own 3D spaces and express yourself creatively. On Soulside you start with an empty room, add 
images and colors, draw and write text. 
SHARE

your inner views with others, you learn to see yourself through the eyes of others. You feel more alive. Learn 
more about yourself and your friends. 
DIVERSITY 
Choose from a variety of 3D objects, PNGs. Apply exciting visual effects and upload audio snippets. This is 
a completely new and fun way to express yourself creatively and show your own take on things. 
VISUALIZE 
In Soulside, your imagination takes shape. By visualizing your ideas, they become more real to you. Make 
your wishes and dreams visible to better realize them. Use Soulside to focus and feel your dreams. 
REFLECT 
When you understand yourself better, you feel more comfortable in your skin. Learn more about yourself 
by creating spaces around personal issues. Ask yourself the questions you've never asked yourself before. 
See what answers you give. 
POSITIVITY 
We focus on positivity and constructive feedback. Feel good after using Soulside because you created 
something personal and meaningful. Be proud of yourself and discover new talents in yourself. Do your 
friends a favor and comment on their Spaces and motivate them to open up. Become part of the Soulside community. 
STORYTELLING 
Create your own series by creating a series of consecutive Spaces that tell a story. This way you can 
easily create an impressive story about your experience. Create incredibly beautiful 3D collages, with 
minimal effort and brilliant graphics. The latest 3D technology makes it possible.
