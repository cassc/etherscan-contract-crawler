/// @title H2H competitions
/// @author Luis Pando
/// @notice It consumes VRF v2 from Chainlink. It has the role
/// "operator" that is the one used by a backend app to make some calls
/// @dev It saves in an ordered array the player wallet and the current
/// entries count. So buying entries has a complexity of O(1)
/// For calculating the winner, from the huge random number generated by Chainlink
/// a normalized random is generated by using the module method, adding 1 to have
/// a random from 1 to entriesCount.
/// So next step is to perform a binary search on the ordered array to get the
/// player O(log n)
/// Example:
/// 0 -> { 1, player1} as player1 buys 1 entry
/// 1 -> {51, player2} as player2 buys 50 entries
/// 2 -> {52, player3} as player3 buys 1 entry
/// 3 -> {53, player4} as player4 buys 1 entry
/// 4 -> {153, player5} as player5 buys 100 entries
/// So the setWinner method performs a binary search on that sorted array to get the upper bound.
/// If the random number generated is 150, the winner is player5. If the random number is 20, winner is player2
///
/// There are 3 possible scenarios for a competition
/// -SCENARIO 1. If there are enough players, it calls chainlink VRF v2 to get a winner
/// that takes all.
/// -SCENARIO 2. If there are players, but not enough, the first one will get unfulfilledAmount
/// (for example 0.6 ETH) instead of the amount entered to buy (for example 0.55 ETH).
/// The rest of the players get the amount entered to buy (0.55 ETH) so there is an incentive
/// to be the first to participate. It is designed to allow n participants, not only 2.
/// The contract must have some ETH in the balance to cover the difference between the amount used
/// to buy and the failureAmount (0.05 ETH in this competition).
/// But there is no need to call stake, just transfer ETH to the contract
/// -SCENARIO 3. If there are no players at all, the competition is canceled, and no fund is sent
/// to anyone
/// In scenario 1, the status of the competition is ENDED. In scenario 2 is UNFULFILLED and in 3,
/// the status of the competition is CANCELED
