/**
 * @title BreederDaoTokenWallet
 * @notice This contract is built on top of the base BreederDaoToken functionality.
 * It allows wallet beneficiaries to use the deposited funds to perform specific function calls
 * on specific contracts.
 *
 * The idea is that supporters with locked tokens can participate in the protocol
 * but disallow any release before the vesting/lock schedule.
 * The beneficiary can issue authorized function calls to this contract that will
 * get forwarded to a target contract. A target contract is any of our protocol contracts.
 * The function calls allowed are queried to the BreederDaoTokenManager, this way
 * the same configuration can be shared for all the created lock wallet contracts.
 *
 * NOTE: Contracts used as target must have its function signatures checked to avoid collisions
 * with any of this contract functions.
 * Beneficiaries need to approve the use of the tokens to the protocol contracts. For convenience
 * the maximum amount of tokens is authorized.
