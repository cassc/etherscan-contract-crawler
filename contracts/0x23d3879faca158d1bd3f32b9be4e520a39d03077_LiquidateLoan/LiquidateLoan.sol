    * to make executing a liquidation  flexible calculations are done outside of the contract and sent via parameters here
    * _assetToLiquidate - the token address of the asset that will be liquidated
    * _flashAmt - flash loan amount (number of tokens) which is exactly the amount that will be liquidated
    * _collateral - the token address of the collateral. This is the token that will be received after liquidating loans
    * _userToLiquidate - user ID of the loan that will be liquidated
    * _amountOutMin - when using uniswap this is used to make sure the swap returns a minimum number of tokens, or will revert
    * _swapPath - the path that uniswap will use to swap tokens back to original tokens
