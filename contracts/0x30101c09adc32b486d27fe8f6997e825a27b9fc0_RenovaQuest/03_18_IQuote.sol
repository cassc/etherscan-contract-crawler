 * - intra-chain: atomic transactions within one chain
 * - cross-chain: multi-leg transactions between two chains, which utilize interoperability protocols
 *                such as Wormhole.
 *
 * Separately, there are two trading modes:
 * - RFQ-T: the trader signs the transaction, the market maker signs the quote
 * - RFQ-M: both the trader and Market Maker sign the quote, any relayer can sign the transaction
