/**
 * @notice In terms of user-facing functionality, the Router is responsible for:
 * - orchestrating trades
 * - managing cross-chain permissions
 *
 * Every trade requires consent from two parties: the Trader and the Market Maker.
 * However, there are two models to establish consent:
 * - RFQ-T: in this model, the Market Maker provides an EIP-191 signature for the quote,
 *   while the Trader signs the transaction and submits it on-chain
 * - RFQ-M: in this model, the Trader provides an EIP-712 signature for the quote,
 *   the Market Maker provides an EIP-191 signature, and a 3rd party relays the trade.
 *   The 3rd party can be the Market Maker itself.
 *
 * In terms of Hashflow internals, the Router maintains a set of authorized pool
 * contracts that are allowed to be used for trading. This allowlist creates
 * guarantees against malicious behavior, as documented in specific places.
 *
 * The Router contract is not upgradeable. In order to change functionality, a new
 * Router has to be deployed, and new HashflowPool contracts have to be deployed
 * by the Market Makers.
