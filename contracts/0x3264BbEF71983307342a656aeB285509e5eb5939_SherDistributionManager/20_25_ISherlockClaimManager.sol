  // Claim initiator (Sherlock) has to pay 22.2k to dispute a claim,
  // so we will execute a safeTransferFrom(claimInitiator, address(this), 22.2k).
  // We need to approve the contract 22.2k as it will be transferred from address(this).

  // The 22.2k consists of 2 * (BOND + final fee charged by UMA), as follows:
  // 1. On requestAndProposePriceFor(), the fee will be 10k: 9600 BOND + 1500 UMA's final fee;
  // 2. On disputePriceFor(), the fee will be the same 10k.
  // note that half of the BOND (4800) + UMA's final fee (1500) is "burnt" and sent to UMA

  // UMA's final fee can be changed in the future, which may result in lower or higher required staked amounts for escalating a claim.

  // On settle, either the protocolAgent (dispute success) or sherlockCore (dispute failure)
  // will receive 9600 + 4800 + 1500 = 15900. In addition, the protocolAgent will be entitled to
  // the claimAmount if the dispute is successful/

  // lastClaimID <-- starts with 0, so initial id = 1
  // have claim counter, easy to identify certain claims by their number
  // but use hash(callback.request.propose + callback.timestamp) as the internal UUID to handle the callbacks

  // In case these need to be updated, deploy different contract and upgrade it on the sherlock gov side.
