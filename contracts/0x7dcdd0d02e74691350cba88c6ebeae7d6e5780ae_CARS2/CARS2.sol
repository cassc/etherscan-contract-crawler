          A sleek British sports car talks directly to us in a
          pixilated, garbled video. He's OUT OF BREATH. Crates are
          visible behind him. We're in the shadowy bowels of a steel
          room.
                         
                          LELAND TURBO
           This is Agent Leland Turbo. I have
           a flash transmission for Agent Finn
           McMissile.

           Finn. My cover's been compromised.
           Everything's gone pear-shaped.

           You won't believe what I've found
           out here.
                         
          He angles our camera view, reveals a PORTHOLE through which
          we can see flames rising in the distance.
                         
                          LELAND TURBO
           This is bigger than anything we've
           ever seen. And no one even knows it
           exists. Finn, I need backup. But
           don't call the cavalry - it could
           blow the operation. And be careful.
           It's not safe out here!
                         
          ANGRY VOICES O.S. Time for Turbo to go.

           Transmitting my grids now. Good
           luck!

          TITLE CARD: CARS 2
                         
                         
          EXT. SOMEWHERE IN THE NORTH PACIFIC - NIGHT
                         
          A TINY CRAB BOAT (CRABBY) crests over massive swells.
                         
                          CRABBY
           Alright buddy, we're here. Right
           where you paid me to bring you.
           Question is, why?
                         
          A metallic blue sports car, circa the `60s, emerges from the
           2.
                         
                         
          shadows. Cagey, smooth, he'd turn heads driving through any
          intersection in the world. Meet FINN MCMISSILE.
                         
                          FINN
           I'm looking for a car.
                         
                          CRABBY
           A car? Hey pal, you can't get any
           further away from land than out
           here.
                         
                          FINN
           Exactly where I want to be.
                         
                          CRABBY
           Well I got news for you, buddy.
           There's nobody out here but us.
                         
          Suddenly, a HORN -- a COMBAT SHIP, the size of most cruise
          ships. FINN quickly backs into the shadows, out of sight.
                         
                          COMBAT SHIP
           What are you doing out here?
                         
                          CRABBY
           What does it look like, genius? I'm
           crabbing!
                         
                          COMBAT SHIP
           Well turn around and go back where
           you came from.
                         
                          CRABBY
           Yeah? And who's gonna make me?
                         
          A laser sight hits Crabby between the eyes.
                         
                          CRABBY
           Alright, alright! Don't get your
           prop in a twist.
           (as he turns to leave)
           What a jerk. Sorry, buddy. Looks
           like it's the end of the line.
           Buddy?
                         
          ON CRABBY'S DECK: Finn is gone.
                          CUT TO:
                         
          FINN - He HANGS off the side of COMBAT SHIP, clandestine.
                         
          We're with Finn as the ship continues on, cuts through the
          darkness with purpose. Suddenly small flames appear, perhaps
          a knot or so away. Then WHOOSH!!! A flame rises above Finn,
          the ship. It illuminates an OIL DERRICK.
           3.
                         
                         
          THWAP! Finn fires a GRAPPLING HOOK to the derrick and SWINGS
          toward it. He's going to SLAM into the side with brute force
                         WHEN ---
                         
          --- HIS TIRES sprout a magnetic exoskeleton. He STICKS to the
          derrick and now DRIVES VERTICALLY UP UP UP...
                         
          From this vantage point, hundreds of derricks appear.
                         
          EXT. PLATFORM - OIL DERRICK - MOMENTS LATER
                         
          Finn approaches a loading bay from above, hides. He watches
          as GREMLINS, PACERS and assorted other cars scurry about.
                         
           FINN (INTO RADIO)
           Leland Turbo, this is Finn
           McMissile. I'm at the rally point.
           Over.
                         
          No response.
                         
           FINN (INTO RADIO)
           Leland, it's Finn. Please respond.
           Over.
                         
          AN ACCESS DOOR OPENS LOUDLY below. A boxy, monacle-wearing
          German car enters. This is PROFESSOR OTTO ZUNDAPP.
                         
                          PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
           (in German and English)
           Too many cars here. Out of my way!
                         
                          FINN
           Professor Zundapp?
                         
           PACER (O.S.)
           Here it is, Professor.
                         
          Zundapp approaches a NOSY PACER who idles next to a CRATE.
                         
                          NOSY PACER
           You wanted to see this before we
           load it?
                         
                          PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
           Ah, yes. Very carefully...
                         
          A forklift opens the crate -- inside is a TV CAMERA, packed
          carefully in foam. Finn SNAPS PHOTOS FURIOUSLY.
                         
                          NOSY PACER
           Oh. A TV camera. What does it
           actually do?
           4.
                         
                         
                          PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
           This camera is extremely dangerous.
                         
                          FINN
                          (TO HIMSELF)
           What are you up to now, Professor?
                         
          Finn, angling for a better view, FIRES SUSPENSION WIRES ---
                         
          --- which sail clear to the other side of the derrick ---
                         
          --- THOK! They hook tightly onto a steel girder.
                         
          Finn slides out ONTO THE WIRE like an acrobat, then expels
          another cross-wire for support.
                         
                          PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
           This is valuable equipment. Make
           sure it is properly secured for the
           voyage.
                         
                          NOSY PACER
           You got it.
                         
          Finn LOWERS HIMSELF. He snaps more pictures.
                         
           GREM (O.S.)
           Hey, Professor Z!
                         
          Zundapp turns as a CRANE LOWERS A CAR-SIZED CRATE. GREM and
          ACER, an orange Gremlin and a green Pacer, flank it.
                         
                          GREM
           This is one of those British spies
           we told you about.
                         
                          ACER
           Yeah. This one we caught sticking
           his bumper where it didn't belong.
                         
          Finn PRODUCES SEMI-AUTOMATIC GUNS from his side, readies
          himself for a tag-team spy fight with his buddy Leland.
                         
                          PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
           Agent Leland Turbo.
                         
          The crate is lifted, revealing a CRUSHED, CUBED Leland Turbo.
                         
          Finn's eyes go wide. Suddenly --- WHOOOSHHH! Another derrick
          flame rises behind him, casts a Finn-shaped SHADOW over the
          Professor. He looks up.
           5.
                         
                         
                          PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
           It's Finn McMissile! He's seen the
           camera! Kill him!!
                         
          Finn UNLOADS with bullets as he starts to retreat --- He
                         STOPS:
                         
          BAD GUY CARS are waiting for him on the catwalk where he just
          came from - BLOWTORCHES ready.
                         
          Finn, stuck in midair, notices an angry CRANE. Finn GRINS,
          having just found his escape.
                         
          THWAPTHWAPTHWAP!!! Finn releases three of his four cables,
          swinging, Indiana Jones-style on the last one TOWARD THE
                         CRANE ---
                         
          --- where he lands on its BOOM, drives UP and LAUNCHES OFF IT
          where he LANDS - MOVING - onto another deck!
                         
          Finn now DRIVES, spraying oil and screeching around corners.
          A GREMLIN in pursuit hits the oil patch, loses control ---
                         
          --- and PLUMMETS OFF the side of the rig!
                         
          The Gremlin FALLS... it's like an eternity...
                         
          He smashes into the water and breaks into a million pieces.
                         
          ON FINN - Now set upon by 20 or 30 MORE pursuing cars. He has
          nowhere to go but UP UP UP a ramp toward the helipad. He
          spies some GASOLINE BARRELS, fires a SINGLE BULLET which cuts
          through its leather straps, sending barrels DOWN the ramp,
          PAST FINN ---
                         
          --- PAST the pursuing CARS ---
                         
          --- to the bottom where they EXPLODE in a CHAIN REACTION back
          UP THE RAMP, taking out at least 15 CARS!
                         
          ON THE HELIPAD - Finn blasts into view, pulls to a stop. No
          more road. Nowhere else to go.
                         
          The 20 BAD GUY CARS that are still in pursuit surround him,
          fire up their blowtorches. About to pounce.
                         
          Finn GRINS. The second time we've seen this grin. It means
          he's got something cooking.
                         
          Finn's REVERSE LIGHTS appear. He DRIVES BACKWARD off the edge
          of the helipad to the SHOCK of the other cars.
                         
          Finn falls. He turns himself so he's grill first, cleanly
          cutting into the water.
           6.
                         
                         
          He EMERGES, now sprouting HYDROFOIL and speeds away.
                         
                          GREM
                          (NONPLUSSED)
           Get to the boats.
                         
          THE BOATS - an army of combat ships quickly DROP into the sea
          and CHURN WATER with unprecedented fury as they quickly make
          up the distance between them and Finn, FIRING BULLETS as they
          do so.
                         
                          ACER
           He's getting away!
                         
                          COMBAT SHIP
           Not for long.
                         
          The LEAD COMBAT SHIP quietly drops a TORPEDO into the water.
          It skips along, connecting with Finn in his rear and
          EXPLODING with such force that water skyrockets into the
          night clouds.
                         
          UNDERWATER - McMissile SINKS. Then, he blinks. He GRINS.
          We're starting to like this grin and what follows it. He now
          CONVERTS into a submarine. From his trunk he releases four
          DECOY tires which float to the surface like body parts.
                         
          ON THE DERRICK - Professor Zundapp watches it all from far
          away.
                         
           GREM (OVER RADIO)
           He's dead, Professor.
                         
                          PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
           Wunderbar. With Finn McMissile
           gone, who can stop us now?
                         
          EXT. RADIATOR SPRINGS - DAY
                         
          TOW MATER, a rusty tow truck, putters into view.
                         
                          MATER
           Mater. Tow Mater, that's who... is

          He approaches a broken-down sedan on the side of the road. He
          drives around to the front, catching OTIS' face for the first
          time.
                         
                          MATER
           Hey, Otis!
           7.
                         
                         
                          OTIS
           Hey, Mater. Gosh, I'm so sorry. I
           thought I could make it this time,
           but...
           (he tries to start his
           engine, stalls)
           Smooth like pudding, huh? Ah, who
           am I kidding? I'll always be a
           lemon.
                         
          Mater hooks his friend and starts towing him.
                         
                          MATER
           Well dadgum, you're leaking oil
           again. Must be your gaskets. Hey,
           look on the bright side: This is
           your tenth tow this month, so that
           means it's on the house.
                         
                          OTIS
           You're the only one that's nice to
           lemons like me, Mater.
                         
                          MATER
           Don't sweat it. These things happen
           to everybody, Otis.
                         
                          OTIS
           But you never leak oil.
                         
                          MATER
           Yeah, but I ain't perfect. Don't
           tell nobody, but I think my rust is
           starting to show through.
                         
          Mater and Otis drive past THE RADIATOR SPRINGS WELCOME SIGN.
          It has been amended to say: "Home of Lightning McQueen."
                         
                          OTIS
           Hey, is Lightning McQueen back yet?
                         
                          MATER
           Not yet.
                         
                          OTIS
           He must be crazy-excited about
           winning his fourth Piston Cup.
           Four! Wow!
           8.
                         
                         
                          MATER
           Yeah, we're so dadgum proud of him.
           But I sure wish he'd hurry up and
           get back `cause we got a whole
           summer's worth of best friend fun
           to make up for. Just me and --
                         
          Ahead of them, a half-mile off, a RED RACE CAR is visible.
                         
                          MATER
           --- McQueen!
                         
          Mater FLOORS IT, dragging poor Otis behind him.
                         
                          OTIS
           Uh, Mater? I'm in no hurry. You
           don't need to go so fast!
                         
          Boom! They hit a bump. Otis catches air.

           Halfway to the county line.
                         
                          RAMONE
           Not bad, man.

           Mater, it's so good to see you.
                         
                          MATER
           You too, buddy.
                         
          Mater and McQueen do an ELABORATE TIRE BUMP (fist bump
          style).
                         
                          MATER
           Oh, man. You ain't gonna believe
           the things I got planned for us.
                         
          Everyone watches as the tire bump continues.

                          MATER
                          (TO MCQUEEN)
           You ready to have some serious fun?
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Well, actually I've got something
           to show you first.
                         
          INT. RADIATOR SPRINGS MUSEUM - DAY
                         
          CLOSE ON THE PISTON CUP. It has now changed, been adorned
          with a small likeness of Doc. It says "Hudson Hornet Piston
          Cup."
                         
                          MATER
           Wow. I can't believe they renamed
           the Piston Cup after our very own
           Doc Hudson.
                         
          McQueen and Mater are alone, the museum closed to the public.
          McQueen approaches a "Hudson Hornet" wall with Doc's three
          Piston cups, framed articles, other racing ephemera.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           I know Doc said these things were
           just old cups, but to have someone
           else win it just didn't feel right,
           you know?
                         
                          MATER
           Well, Doc would've been real proud
           of you. That's for sure.
                         
          McQueen takes this in.

          McQueen and Mater exit the Doc Hudson Museum.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Alright, pal. I've been waiting all
           summer for this. What've you got
           planned?
                         
                          MATER
           You sure you can handle it?
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Come on, you know who you're
           talking to? This is Lightning
           McQueen. I can handle anything.

          Mater and McQueen roll on an old train track, their tires
          off. They're on their rims.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Uh.... Mater?!
                         
                          MATER
           Just remember, your brakes ain't
           gonna work on these!
                         
          As they head INTO A DARK TUNNEL ---

           Mater!
                         
           MATER (O.S.)
           Relax, these train tracks ain't
           been used in years!
                         
          From inside the tunnel a loud TRAIN HORN. The two friends
          emerge, going as fast as they can on train tracks, uphill,
          with no tires.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Come on, come on! Faster, faster!
                         
          Moments later a harmless GALLOPING GOOSE appears, oversized
          horn visible, cackling and laughing at his prank.

           This is gonna be good!
                         
          They blow their horns and he TIPS OVER, tractor-tipping
          style. They LAUGH at the gag, but soon realize the earth
          mover's GIANT EXHAUST PIPE is directly above them.
                         
                          MATER
           Uh-oh. This ain't gonna be good.
                         
          The exhaust pipe BELCHES. McQueen and Mater are BLASTED out
          of view.

          exhausted. Mater is still full of energy.

                          MATER

           And my favorite souvenir?

                          MATER
           Shoot, that was nothing. Wait til
           you see what I got planned for
           tonight.

           Mater, Mater. Whoa. I was kind of
           thinking of just a quiet dinner.
                         
                          MATER
           That's exactly what I was thinking.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           No, I... I meant with Sally, Mater.
                         
                          MATER
           Even better! You, me and Miss Sally
           going out for supper.
                         
          McQueen pulls around in front of Mater, stops.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Mater, I meant it would be just me
           and Sally.

                          MCQUEEN
           It's just for tonight. We'll do
           whatever you want tomorrow.

          It's been converted into a white-tablecloth restaurant, with
          cars dining al fresco and a hopping gastropub inside.
                         
          MCQUEEN AND SALLY have a prime table with a view of Radiator
          Springs and the starry night sky.
                         
                          SALLY
           This is so nice.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           I can't tell you how good it is to
           be here alone. Just the two of us.
           Finally, you and me ---
                         
           MATER (O.S.)
           Good evening.
                         
          Mater is at their table, dressed as a waiter.
                         
                          MATER
           My name is Mater and I'll be your
           waiter.
                          (TO HIMSELF)
           Mater the waiter. That's funny
           right there.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Mater, you work here?
                         
                          MATER
           Well yeah I work here. What'd you
           think, I just snuck in here when
           nobody was looking and pretended to
           be your waiter, just so I could
           hang out with you?
                         
          McQueen and Sally exchange a look.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Oh, yeah. How ridiculous would that
           be?
                         
                          MATER
           Now, can I start you two lovebirds
           off with a couple drinks?
           14.
                         
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Yes. I'll have my usual.
                         
                          SALLY
           You know what? I'm going to have
           that too.
                         
          Mater blinks.
                         
                          MATER
           Uh, right. Your usual.
                          CUT TO:
                         
          INSIDE AT THE BAR - Fillmore and Sarge watch as Guido mixes
          drinks, ala "Cocktail." Mater arrives.
                         
                          MATER
           Guido! What's McQueen's usual?
                         
                          GUIDO
           (in Italian, subtitled)
           How should I know?
                         
                          MATER
           Perfect! Give me two of `em.
                         
                          SARGE
           Quiet! My program's on.
                         
           MEL DORADO (O.S.)
           Tonight on "The Mel Dorado Show"!
                         
          ON THE BAR TV - "THE MEL DORADO SHOW," a cable talk show,
          begins with file footage of MILES AXLEROD, a sleek SUV.
                         
           MEL DORADO (ON TV)
           His story gripped the world! Oil
           billionaire Miles Axlerod, in an
           attempt to become the first car to
           circumnavigate the globe without
           GPS, ironically ran out of gas and
           found himself trapped in the wild!
                         
          We see images of newspaper headlines, search crews.
                         
           MEL DORADO (ON TV)
           Feared dead, he emerged 36 days
           later, running on a fuel he'd
           distilled himself from the natural
           elements! Since then he's sold his
           oil fortune, converted himself from
           a gas-guzzler into an electric car,
           and has devoted his life to finding
           a renewable, clean-burning fuel!
           15.
                         
                         
          Images of oil derricks torn down; Miles Axlerod getting
          converted to electric; lab scientists testing chemicals.
                         
           MEL DORADO (ON TV)
           Now he claims to have done it with
           his Allinol.
                         
          Images of fields, rivers, vegetables, and mountains all
          combining to form the Allinol logo.
                         
           MEL DORADO (ON TV)
           And to show the world what his new
           superfuel can do, he's created a
           racing competition like no other,
           inviting the greatest champions
           from around the globe to battle in
           the first ever World Grand Prix.
           Welcome Sir Miles Axlerod.
                         
          SIR MILES AXLEROD arrives, parks across from Mel's desk.
                         
           MILES AXLEROD (ON TV)
           Thank you, Mel. It is very good to
           be here. Now listen to me: Big Oil.
           It costs a fortune. Pollution is
           getting worse. I mean, come on.
           It's a fossil fuel. Fossil. As in
           dead dinosaurs. And we all know
           what happened to them. Alternative
           energy is the future. Trust me,
           Mel, after seeing Allinol in action
           at the World Grand Prix, nobody
           will ever go back to gasoline
           again.
                         
                          MATER
                          (TO FILLMORE)
           What happened to the dinosaurs,
           now?
                         
           MEL DORADO (ON TV)
           And on satellite, a World Grand
           Prix competitor and one of the
           fastest cars in the world,
           Francesco Bernoulli.
                         
          Across the screen: LIVE FROM ROME, ITALY. We meet Formula
          race car FRANCESCO BERNOULLI.
                         
           FRANCESCO (ON TV)
           It is an honor, Signore Dorado. For
           you.
           16.
                         
                         
           MEL DORADO (ON TV)
           Miles, why not invite Lightning
           McQueen?
                         
          Mater, collecting his drinks, looks up, half-intrigued.
                         
           MILES AXLEROD (ON TV)
           Of course we invited him. But
           apparently after a very long racing
           season he is taking some time off
           to rest.
                         
           FRANCESCO (ON TV)
           Lightning McQueen would not have a
           chance against Francesco!
                         
          Mater doesn't like this.
                         
           FRANCESCO (ON TV)
           I can go over 300 kilometers an
           hour! In miles that is like, uh...
           way faster than McQueen.
                         
           MEL DORADO (ON TV)
           Let's go to the phones. Baltimore,
           Maryland, you're on the air.
                         
           CALLER (ON TV)
           Am I on? Hello?
                         
           MEL DORADO (ON TV)
           You're on. Go ahead.
                         
           CALLER (ON TV)
           Hello?
                         
           MEL DORADO (ON TV)
           Go ahead, caller.
                         
          Dial tone.
                         
           MEL DORADO (ON TV)
           Let's go to Radiator Springs.
           You're on, caller.
                         
           MATER'S VOICE (ON TV)
           Yeah, that Italian feller you got
           on there can't talk that way about
           Lightning McQueen. He's the bestest
           race car in the whole wide world.
                         
          Fillmore and Sarge look around. Mater is visible in the back
          of the bar on an office phone.
           17.
                         
                         
                          SARGE
           Uh-oh...
                         
           FRANCESCO (ON TV)
           If he is, how you say "the bestest
           race car," then why must he rest,
           eh?
                         
           MATER'S VOICE (ON TV)
           Cause he knows what's important.
           Every now and then he prefers just
           to slow down, enjoy life.
                         
           FRANCESCO (ON TV)
           Ah, you heard it! Lightning McQueen
           prefers to be slow! Of course, this
           is not news to Francesco. When I
           want to go to sleep I watch one of
           his races. After two laps I am out
           cold.
                         
          Audible RXNS from the bar. A crowd has been forming ever
          since Mater started talking.
                         
           MATER'S VOICE (ON TV)
           That ain't what I meant.
                          CUT TO:
                         
          MCQUEEN AND SALLY - They hear the commotion inside.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Hey, what's going on over there?
           CUT BACK TO:
                         
          THE BAR - Sally and McQueen push through the crowd, see that
          they're watching Francesco on the television.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
                          (TO SALLY)
           Oh, it's that Italian Formula car.
           His name is ---
                         
                          SALLY
           Francesco Bernoulli. No wonder
           there's a crowd.
                         
          When Sally says his name, she enunciates each part, as if
          Italian were her mother's tongue.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Wait, why do you know his name? And
           don't say it like that. It's three
           syllables, not ten.
           18.
                         
                         
                          SALLY
           What? He's nice to look at. You
           know, open-wheeled and all.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           What's wrong with fenders? I
           thought you like my fenders.
                         
           MATER'S VOICE (ON TV)
           Well let me tell you something else
           there, Mr. San Francisco ---
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Mater?
                         
           MATER'S VOICE (ON TV)
           McQueen could drive circles around
           you.
                         
           FRANCESCO (ON TV)
           Driving in circles is all he can
           do, no?
                         
           MATER'S VOICE (ON TV)
           No! I mean yes. I mean he could
           beat you anywhere, anytime, any
           track.
                         
          On McQueen - he looks at Guido who gives a nod over to ---
                         
          --- Mater, turned away from the crowd, still on the phone.
                         
           FRANCESCO (ON TV)
           Mel, can we move on? Francesco
           needs a caller who can provide a
           little more intellectual
           stimulation. Like a dump truck.
                         
          ON MCQUEEN. He doesn't like this at all.
                         
                          MATER
           Ha ha! That shows what you know.
           Dump trucks is dumb.
                         
          Suddenly, Mater is YANKED from the booth and replaced by
          McQueen.
                         
           MCQUEEN (INTO PHONE)
           Yeah, hi, this is Lightning
           McQueen. Look, I don't appreciate
           my best friend being insulted like
           that.
           19.
                         
                         
           FRANCESCO (ON TV)
           McQueen! That was your best friend?
           This is the difference between you
           and Francesco. Francesco knows how
           good he is. He does not need to
           surround himself with tow trucks to
           prove it.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Those are strong words from a car
           that is so fragile.
                         
           FRANCESCO (ON TV)
           Fragil�!? He calls Francesco
           fragil�? Not so fast, McQueen!
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           "Not so fast." What is that, your
           new motto?
                         
          Francesco goes ballistic in Italian. They cut his mic.
                         
           MILES AXLEROD (ON TV)
           Well, this sounds like something
           that needs to be settled on the
           race course. What do you say,
           Lightning McQueen? We've still got
           room for one more racer.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Well, I would love to. The only
           thing is my crew's off for the
           season so ---
                         
          A sound O.S. McQueen turns to see Fillmore, Sarge and Luigi
          flank a tablecloth which is hanging off the bar. Ramone backs
          away, having spray painted "TEAM LIGHTNING MCQUEEN" on it.
          Guido quickly uncorks three wine bottles.
                         
                          GUIDO
           Pit stop.
                         
          McQueen turns back to the phone.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           You know what? They just got back.
           Deal me in, baby. Ka-chow!
                         
          The place ERUPTS IN CHEERS.
                         
          MOMENTS LATER - General excitement as McQueen exits the phone
          booth where Sally waits. Off her look:
           20.
                         
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           I know, I know. I just got back.
           But we won't be long and ---
                         
                          SALLY
           Oh, no, don't worry about me. I've
           got enough to do here. Mater's
           going to have a blast though.
           (off McQueen's silence)
           You're bringing Mater, right? You
           never bring him to any of your
           races.
                         
          McQueen turns to the bar where Mater privately tries their
          drinks, hates it, spits it back in the glass.
                         
                          SALLY
           Just let him sit in the pits, give
           him a headset. C'mon, it'll be a
           thrill of a lifetime for him.
                         
          Mater arrives.
                         
                          MATER
           Your drinks, sir.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Mater.
                         
                          MATER
           I didn't taste it!
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           How'd you like to come and see the
           world with me?
                         
                          MATER
           You mean it?
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           You got me into this thing. You're
           coming along.
                         
                         BEGIN MONTAGE:
                         
          - McQueen is given a new paint job and headlights by Ramone.
          Mater, now sporting a "Team McQueen" emblem, seems psyched as
          well.
                         
          - An airport DEPARTURES SIGN advertises the next flight:
          Tokyo, Japan.
                         
          - Mater waves goodbye with his hook alongside McQueen, Guido,
          Luigi, Fillmore and Sarge as ---
           21.
                         
                         
          --- the rest of Radiator Springs watches them board a plane.
          Red bawls.
                         
          - IN THE JET, LATER. McQueen and Mater are the only ones
          awake, watch an insane Japanese game show.
                         
          - JAPAN AT NIGHT. A stylish Tokyo cityscape of neon, glamour,
          scrolling billboards, vending machines and high-tech
          skyscrapers.
                         
          - INSIDE A SOUVENIR SHOP loaded with McQueen toys: Mater and
          McQueen enter. A tourist sees McQueen and faints.
                         
          - A KABUKI THEATER. Team McQueen watches a methodical dance.
          Mater, dressed in Kabuki makeup, arrives. He looks insane.
                         
          - A SUMO MATCH - Two SUZUKI SAMURAI CARS wrestle over a
          parking space. Mater, now in his element, cheers.
                         
          The MONTAGE ENDS on this high note as we CUT TO ---
                         
          EXT. MUSEUM - TOKYO - NIGHT
                         
          ---- TEAM MCQUEEN, as they roll up the red carpet. Press is
          held at bay behind ropes. WORLD GRAND PRIX and ALLINOL logos
          are strategically placed for maximum press exposure. RACERS
          are interviewed by press behind the red-carpet ropes.
                         
          INT. TOKYO MUSEUM - NIGHT
                         
          Team McQueen enters via a second floor landing which
          overlooks a massive indoor party in a converted museum. As
          they roll down a ramp to the party, they are awed.
                         
                          LUIGI
           Guido, look! Ferraris and tires!
           Let's go!
                         
                          MCQUEEN
                          (IMPRESSED)
           Hey, look at this. Okay now Mater,
           remember: best behavior.
                         
                          MATER
           You got it, buddy. Hey, what's
           that?
                         
          He sees something, peels away.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Mater!
                         
                          LEWIS HAMILTON
           Hey, McQueen, over here!
           22.
                         
                         
          It's fellow racers JEFF GORVETTE and LEWIS HAMILTON. McQueen
          now has no choice but to let Mater go.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Hey, Jeff. Lewis!
                          CUT TO:
                         
          MATER as he approaches a GLASS-ENCLOSED ROCK GARDEN where a
          pitty RAKES rocks with precision. He knocks on the glass with
          his hook.
                         
                          MATER
           Hey! You done good! You got all the
           leaves!
                         
          People turn at the noise he's making.
           CUT BACK TO:
                         
          MCQUEEN, JEFF and LEWIS.
                         
                          JEFF GORVETTE
           Check out that tow truck.
                         
                          LEWIS HAMILTON
           I wonder who that guy's with?
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Will you guys excuse me just for
           one little second?
                         
          He zips over to Mater's side, quickly pulls him out of sight.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Mater, listen. This isn't Radiator
           Springs.
                         
                          MATER
           You're just realizing that? Boy,
           that jet-lag really done a number
           on you.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Mater, look -- things are different
           over here. Which means maybe you
           should, you know, act a little
           different too.
                         
                          MATER
           Different than what?
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Well, just... help me out here,
           buddy. I ---
           23.
                         
                         
                          MATER
           You need help? Shoot, why didn't
           you just say so? That's what a tow
           truck does. Hey, looky there, it's
           Mr. San Francisco!
                         
          FRANCESCO is visible across the room, holding court.
                         
                          MATER
           I'll introduce you.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Mater, no.
                         
                          MATER
           (already on his way)
           Look at me -- I'm helping you
           already!
                         
          On FRANCESCO - MOMENTS LATER. Mater approaches, giddy.
                         
                          MATER
           Hey Mr. San Francisco, I'd like you
           to meet ---
                         
                          FRANCESCO
           Lightning McQueen! Buona sera.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Nice to meet you, Francesco.
                         
                          FRANCESCO
           Yeah, nice to meet you too. You are
           very good-looking. Not as good as I
           thought, but you're good.
                         
                          MATER
                          (TO FRANCESCO)
           Excuse me. Can I get a picture with
           you?
                         
                          FRANCESCO
           Anything for McQueen's friend.
                         
          As Mater poses for a photo with Francesco:
                         
                          MATER
           Miss Sally is gonna flip when she
           sees this. She's Lightning
           McQueen's girlfriend.
                         
                          FRANCESCO
           Oooh.
           24.
                         
                         
                          MATER
           She's a big fan of yours.
                         
                          FRANCESCO
           Hey, she has good taste.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Mater's prone to exaggeration. I
           wouldn't say she's a "big" fan.
                         
                          MATER
           You're right. She's a huge fan. She
           goes on and on about your open
           wheels here.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Mentioning it once doesn't qualify
           as going "on and on."
                         
                          FRANCESCO
           Francesco is familiar with this
           reaction to Francesco. Women
           respect a car that has nothing to
           hide.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Yeah, uh...
                         
                          FRANCESCO
           Let us have a toast.
                         
          McQueen doesn't like where this is going, covers.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Let's.
                         
                          FRANCESCO
           (raising a drink)
           I dedicate my win tomorrow... to
           Miss Sally.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Oh, sorry. I already dedicated MY
           win tomorrow to her. So if we both
           do it, it's really not so special.
           Besides, I don't have a drink.
                         
                          MATER
           I'll go get you one. You mind if I
           borrow a few bucks for one of them
           drinks?
           25.
                         
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           (could kill him)
           They're free, Mater.
                         
                          MATER
           Free? Well, shoot, what am I doing
           here?
                         
          Mater ZIPS OFF.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           I should probably go keep an eye on
           him. See you at the race.
                         
          McQueen starts to leave.
                         
                          FRANCESCO
           Yes, you will see Francesco. But
           not like this.
                         
          Francesco does a 180, so his rear end now faces McQueen.
                         
                          FRANCESCO
           You will see him like this, as he
           drives away from you.
                         
          Francesco wears a bumper sticker that says "Ciao, McQueen!"
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           That's cute. So you had one of
           those made up for all the racers?
                         
                          FRANCESCO
           No.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Okay.
                         
          He rolls off.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           He is so getting beat tomorrow.
                         
          INT. PARTY - MOMENTS LATER
                         
          Lights caress the main stage where a crowd has formed.
                         
                          VOICE
           Ladies and gentlecars... Sir Miles
           Axlerod!
                         
          MILES AXLEROD drives through an infinity fountain, appears.
           26.
                         
                         
                          MILES AXLEROD
           It is my absolute honor to
           introduce to you the competitors in
           the first-ever World Grand Prix.
           From Brazil. Number eight...
                         
          ON FINN MCMISSILE. He appears from the shadows, keeps a
          careful distance from the stage. He ZEROES HIS GAZE ON ---
                         
          --- THE WORLD GRAND PRIX TV CAMERAS which roll, catching
          Miles Axlerod's speech for publicity and posterity.
                         
          Finn's ONBOARD COMPUTER ANALYZES each one, compares to the
          photos we saw him snap on the oil platform. Each one is "NOT
          A MATCH." His view is suddenly disrupted by A BEAUTIFUL
          SPORTS CAR. She approaches Finn. Meet HOLLEY SHIFTWELL.
                         
                          HOLLEY
           A Volkswagen Karmann Ghia has no
           radiator.
                         
                          FINN
           That's because it's air-cooled.
                         
                          HOLLEY
           I'm Agent Shiftwell, Holley
           Shiftwell from the Tokyo Station. I
           have a message from London.
                         
                          FINN
           Not here.
                          (LOUDLY)
           You must try the canapes on the
           mezzanine!
                         
          He moves her onto an elevator. The doors close on them.
                         
          IN THE ELEVATOR, GOING UP.
                         
                          FINN
           So the lab boys analyzed the photo
           I sent? What did they learn about
           the camera?
                         
                          HOLLEY
           It appears to be a standard
           television camera. They said if you
           could get closer photos next time,
           that would be great.
                         
                          FINN
           This was London's message?
           27.
                         
                         
                          HOLLEY
           Oh -- no, no. No sir. Um, the oil
           platforms you were on? Turns out
           they're sitting on the biggest oil
           reserve in the world.
                         
                          FINN
           How did we miss that?
                         
                          HOLLEY
           They'd been scrambling everyone's
           satellites. The Americans actually
           discovered it just before you did.
           They placed an agent on that
           platform, under deep cover. He was
           able to get a photo of the car
           who's running the entire operation.
                         
          The doors OPEN and they exit onto the Mezzanine.
                         
                          FINN
           Who is it? Has anyone seen the
           photo yet?
                         
                          HOLLEY
           No, not yet. The American is here
           tonight to pass it to you. He'll
           signal you when he's ready.
                         
                          FINN
                          GOOD ---
                         
          Finn suddenly STOPS COLD.
                         
                          FINN
           Oh no.
                         
          Professor Zundapp is visible below them. He talks with a few
          Pacers and Gremlins. Finn quickly retreats into the shadows.
          Holley follows suit.
                         
                          HOLLEY
           What is it?
                         
                          FINN
           Change of plan. You're meeting the
           American.
                         
                          HOLLEY
           What, me?
           28.
                         
                         
                          FINN
           Those thugs down there were on the
           oil platform. If they see me, the
           whole mission is compromised.
                         
                          HOLLEY
           No, no. I'm technical, you see. I'm
           in Diagnostics. I'm not a field
           agent.
                         
                          FINN
           You are now.
                          CUT TO:
                         
          MATER as he grabs a drink, keeps moving.
                         
                          MATER
           I'll take one of them.
                         
          He snatches it, drops it in the back where we now see a large
          assortment of drinks balanced.
                         
                          MATER
           Never know which one McQueen'll
           have a hankering for.
                         
          He approaches a sushi bar.
                         
                          MATER
           Hey, what you got here that's free?
           How about that pistachio ice cream?
                         
          He refers to wasabi, of course.
                         
                          SUSHI CHEF
           No, no. Wasabi.
                         
                          MATER
           Oh, same ol', same ol'. What's up
           with you? That looks delicious.
                         
          The chef starts to carve a small scoop aside for Mater.
                         
                          MATER
           Uh, a little more, please.
           It is free, right?
           (the chef adds more)
           Keep it coming. A little more. Come
           on, let's go, it's free! You're
           getting there... Scoop scoop!
                         
          The chef gives in. Scoops a baseball-sized ball out.
           29.
                         
                         
                          MATER
           There you go. Now THAT's a scoop of
           ice cream.
                         
                          SUSHI CHEF
           (in Japanese, subtitles)
           My condolences.
           CUT BACK TO:
                         
          MILES AXLEROD - He's now nearly done with his intros.
                         
                          MILES AXLEROD
           ... and now, our last competitor ---
           Number 95, Lightning McQueen!
                         
          MCQUEEN approaches the microphone, flashes his headlights.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Thank you so much for having us,
           Sir Axlerod. I really look forward
           to racing. This is a great
           opportunity.
                         
                          MILES AXLEROD
           Oh, the pleasure is all ours,
           Lightning. You and your team bring
           excellence and professionalism to
           this competition.
                         
          As if on cue, Mater arrives with a piercing scream of pain.
          Everyone turns as he charges head first toward the stage,
          making a bee-line for that FOUNTAIN.
                         
                          MATER
           Somebody get me water!
                         
          He laps up water from the fountain like a diabetic cat.
                         
                          MATER
                          (LAPPING WATER)
           Sweet relief...
                         
          Miles Axlerod is shocked. The crowd can't believe it.
          Francesco cackles. Mater, now sated, approaches the mic.
                         
                          MATER
           (to the crowd)
           Whatever you do, do not eat the
           free pistachio ice cream. It has
           turned!
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Sir Axlerod, I can explain. This is
           Mater.
           30.
                         
                         
                          MILES AXLEROD
           I know him. This is the bloke that
           called into the television show.
                          (TO MATER)
           You're the one I have to thank.
                         
                          MATER
           No, thank you. This trip's been
           amazing.
                         
                          MILES AXLEROD
                          (TO MCQUEEN)
           He's a little excited, isn't he?
                         
          TILT DOWN to reveal a pool of oil beneath Mater.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Mater!
                         
                          MATER
           But wait, I... oh, shoot.
                         
          McQueen quickly pulls Mater aside, out of earshot of Miles
          Axlerod and the others. McQueen is beside himself.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Mater, you have to get a hold of
           yourself. You're making a scene.
                         
                          MATER
           But I never leak oil. Never.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Go take care of yourself right now.
                         
          Mater drives off.
                         
          ON MATER - MOMENTS LATER
                         
          He drives through the party, frantic.
                         
                          MATER
           Coming through! Excuse me, leakin'
           oil. Where's the bathroom? Thank
           you. I gotta go!
                         
          Someone points Mater down a hallway. He whips around the
                         CORNER ---
                         
          --- and STOPS. Finds himself in front of TWO BATHROOM DOORS,
          neither of which clearly indicate MALE or FEMALE.
           31.
                         
                         
                          MATER
                          (CONFUSED)
           What the...
                         
          Mater chooses one, drives inside. A SHRIEK is heard and Mater
          zips out.
                         
                          MATER
           Sorry ladies!
                         
          He heads into the other door ---
                          CUT TO:
                         
          INT. MEN'S ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Mater rolls in, still `holding it in' like a kid.
                         
                          MATER
           I never leak I never leak I never
           leak...
                         
          He sees someone leaving a stall. He heads in.
                         
          IN THE STALL - Mater enters, looks up.
                         
                          MATER
           Wowee...
                         
          The stall is a complicated apparatus with buttons and lights.
          High-tech Japanese. It suddenly GRABS MATER, hoists him up as
          if he's going to get an oil change.
                         
                          MATER
           What in the---
                         
          A Japanese style cartoon CARICATURE appears on a TV MONITOR,
          followed by images of waterfalls and rivers.
                         
                          MATER
                          (GIGGLING)
           Hey, that tickles.
                         
          The caricature starts talking in Japanese. Suddenly WATER
          FIRES UP underneath Mater's undercarriage, goosing him. He
          freaks out.
                         
          OUTSIDE THE STALL - With Mater's yells audible we see a
          GREMLIN enter, furtive. Suddenly, inexplicably, his frame
          BREAKS APART like an egg, revealing an AMERICAN MUSCLE CAR
          underneath. The pieces of the Gremlin disappear under him,
          clearly his disguise. This is ROD REDLINE - American Agent.
           32.
                         
                         
                          ROD REDLINE

          GREM and ACER have entered, hesitate briefly when they see
          Rod Redline.
                         
          Rod Redline, careful, slides a gun out of his tire. He is
          suddenly CHARGED by the AMCs --- Rod SPINS AROUND and gets a
          shot off but is SLAMMED HEAD FIRST. A TIGHT, CLOSE-QUARTERS

          OUTSIDE THE STALL - Rod is being pulverized. Just when he

          Rod Redline is in bad shape. He backs away, betrays a look of
          concern. He's in trouble here.
                         
          ACER burns rubber, ready to finish him off. Just as he shifts

           a disguise. You guys are stuck
           looking like that.
                         
          This doesn't help him. They DROP HIM onto a TREADMILL, lock
          him down. A container is wheeled forward and Rod is plied

                          PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
           Allinol by itself is good for you.
                         
          Zundapp hits a button and the TREADMILL starts Rod's wheels
          spinning at a high rate of speed.

           But after microscopic examination,
           I have found that it has one small
           weakness. When hit with an
           electromagnetic pulse, it becomes
           extremely dangerous.

          Grem pushes a World Grand Prix CAMERA - the same one that
          was in the box back at the oil derrick. He points it at Rod
          Redline.

           Is that all you want? I got a whole

                          PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
           You were very interested in this
           camera on the oil platform. Now you
           will witness what it really does.
                         
                          ROD REDLINE
           Whatever you say, Professor.
                         
          Acer pushes a TV MONITOR toward Rod. On it, surveillance
          footage from the party. Clearly, they were watching and
          recording him there.

           Your mother. Oh no, I'm sorry. It

                          PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
           Fifty percent power.
           (to Rod Redline)
           This camera is actually an
           electromagnetic pulse emitter.

           The Allinol is now heating to a
           boil, dramatically expanding,
           causing the engine block to crack
           under the stress, forcing oil into
           the combustion chamber.
                         
          Rod Redline's engine starts to CRACK and BREAK.

           What do I care? I can replace an
           engine block.
                         
                          PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
           You may be able to, but after full
           impact of the pulse, unfortunately,
           there will be nothing to replace.

          The monitor reveals MATER, rolling out of the bathroom and
          down the hall.
                         
          Rod Redline, seeing this, does the world's most subtle double
          take. We caught it, but there's no way anyone else in the

          As Grem turns up the machine even MORE, the Professor makes a
          call.
                         
           PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP (INTO PHONE)
           Yes sir. We believe the infiltrator
           has passed along sensitive
           information.
           (beat, listening)
           I will take care of it before any
           damage can be done.

          Zundapp kicks the camera's power into the RED.

           Second, the course itself, and it's
           like nothing we've ever seen.
           David, how exactly does this
           competition work?
                         
           DAVID HOBBSCAP (V.O.)
           Well, Brent, all three of these
           street courses are classic round-
           the-house racetracks.

           This means that the LMP and Formula

           GT and Touring cars like Spain's
           Miguel Camino should make up some
           ground but I doubt it'll be enough
           to stop Francesco from absolutely
           running away with it.

           Woah, now just hold your
           horsepower. You're forgetting the
           most important factor here. That
           early dirt track section of the
           course! The dirt is supposed to be
           the great equalizer in this race.

           DARRELL CARTRIP (V.O.)
           And don't forget Lightning McQueen!
           His mentor, the Hudson Hornet, was
           one of the greatest dirt track
           racers of all time. In my opinion,
           McQueen is the best all-around
           racer in this competition.

           clearly not seeing this for what it
           is: Francesco's race to lose.

           Francesco is triple speed.
           (closes his eyes)
           Francesco. Is. Triple speed.
           Francesco likes this, McQueen. It's
           really getting him into the zone!
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           He is so getting beat today.
                         
          The starting lights click down from RED to YELLOW to GREEN.

           It's his cover. One of the best
           I've seen, too. Look at the detail
           on that rust. It must have cost him
           a fortune.

                          FINN
           There's probably heat on him. Be
           patient.
                         
                          HOLLEY
           Right, of course. He'll signal us

           DAVID HOBBSCAP (V.O.)
           Francesco is brought to a

           BRENT MUSTANGBURGER (V.O.)
           Lightning McQueen is the first to
           take advantage. And just like that,

           derby!

           Everyone's jostling for position as
           we hit the asphalt again.
                         
          Francesco crests the hill, in last place. He bites down,
          determined, then CHASES.
                         
           BRENT MUSTANGBURGER (V.O.)
           Francesco lost a lot of momentum in
           the dirt. He's got some serious
           work ahead of him if he wants to
           get back in this race.

          VARIOUS SHOTS OF TOKYO as the racers move through the Rainbow
          Bridge. Bit by bit, Francesco ekes his way toward the front,

          and Acer are manning this one. They focus it on the racers as
          they approach.
                         
           PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP (OVER RADIO)
           It is time.

           Roger that.
                         
          ON THE TRACK - A racer (Miguel Camino) suddenly PLUMES WITH
          SMOKE and skids out.
                         
           DARRELL CARTRIP (V.O.)
           Oh! Miguel Camino has blown an
           engine!
                         
           BRENT MUSTANGBURGER (V.O.)
           Very unusual, Darrell. He's been so
           consistent all year.
                         
          Camino quickly pits, passing McQueen's pit where Mater is
          visible.
                         
          ON GREM AND ACER, watching from above.

           What is it?
                         
                          GREM
           It's that tow truck from the

                          ACER
           The one from the bathroom?
                         
                          GREM
           Yeah, the one the American Agent
           passed the device to.
                         
                          ACER

                          GREM
           What about him? He's in the pits!

          Acer exits, with purpose.
                         
          ON FINN AND HOLLEY, still in their office hideaway. Holley's

           Cross-referencing with the photos
           from the oil derricks... Yep. His
           VIN numbers match.
                         
                          FINN

           Conducting analysis on the target.
                         
          The computer finds more and more bad guy Pacers and Gremlins
          are in the crowd.
                         
                          HOLLEY
           He's not the only one here.
           Three... five... they're
           everywhere. And they're all closing
           in on... oh no.
                         
          We PAN OVER to see it's MATER.

           Finn? Finn, where are you?
                         
          She turns. He's GONE, leaving only an open window.

           HOLLEY (OVER MATER'S RADIO)
           Get out of the pit now. Do you hear
           me?
                         
          Mater realizes this girl has somehow broken into his radio.
                         
           MATER (INTO RADIO)
           Hey, I know you. You're that girl
           from the party last night. You

          ON THE TRACK - McQueen boxes out Francesco, holds his slim

           Let's keep this line clear.
                         
          BOOM! A racer behind McQueen suddenly expels black smoke,
          skids out of control.
                         
          ON GREM - laughing. That was clearly his handiwork.

           Get out now!
                         
          We CUT BACK TO ---

                          MATER
           Well, all right but I usually like
           to have a proper detailing done
           before I meet a lady friend.
                         
          He moves toward the back PIT DOOR, is about to open it.

           Then this shouldn't hurt at all.
                         
          He empties the extinguisher in their eyes, speeds past. They
          try and follow, but have been blinded. One of them crashes
          right into a COP.
                         
          ON FINN - Already on the move, along a side street.

           Miss Shiftwell?
                         
          ON HOLLEY - Tracking everything on a grid map. Mater looks
          like Pac Man, weaving through the streets as bad guys close
          in all around him.
                         
                          HOLLEY
           I've got him in the back alleys
           east of the garages. Multiple

           Keep him moving. I'm on my way.

          McQueen drifts outside allowing Francesco to slip past!

           I cannot believe what I just saw,

           You don't open up the inside like
           that!
                         
          IN THE BACK ALLEYS - As Mater moves on he's followed by
          Pacers and Gremlins. Suddenly ---
                         
          --- CABLES whip in front of them, pulling over flower vending
          machines and sending the shop's owners into a frenzy. They
          direct their attention to the AMCs, who try and explain.
                         
          ON FINN, admiring his handiwork as he appears. Just as he
          turns to leave he's BROADSIDED and pushed INTO A DARK ALLEY.
                         
          IN THE ALLEY - Finn finds himself boxed by two Pacers and
          pushed toward ---
                         
          --- ACER, who now holds a FLAME THROWER.

          He hits the flame. WHOOOSSSH!!

          ON ANOTHER STREET - Mater clicks along, still looking for
          Holley. Just as he passes the alley entrance where Finn
          stares down death:
                         
           HOLLEY (OVER RADIO)
           You're doing brilliantly. Now just
           stay focused.
                         
                          MATER
           What's that? You want me to head
           toward that ruckus?
                         
          Mater turns INTO the alley.
                         
           HOLLEY (OVER RADIO)
           No! Don't go down that street!
                         
          IN THE ALLEY - Finn, now nearly pushed completely into the
          flame thrower, leaps into the air. He FIGHTS BACK, using his
          wheels, axle, indeed his entire car frame as if he were
          human, kicking and tossing and shooting his enemies.
                         
          Mater witnesses the whole thing.
                         
                          MATER
           Wow! A live karate demonstration!
                         
          ON THE TRACK - McQueen, now playing catch-up again, scowls.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Stop it, Mater. Just sign off.
                         
          IN THE BACK ALLEY - Finn polishes off the AMCs by firing a
          bullet into a gas main line, causing an EXPLOSION that tosses
          Acer through the air where he lands in a NOODLE SHOP'S SIGN.
                         
          ON THE TRACK - The end of the race is nigh ---

          IN THE ALLEY - Finn heaves breaths, surveys his damage.
                         
                          MATER
           That was cool! Hey, can I get your
           autograph?
           51.
                         
                         
          Mater approaches when a MASS OF RACE FANS burst out a door,
          momentarily blocking Mater's view of Finn. Once the fans have
          past, Finn has disappeared.
                         
                          MATER
           Hey, where'd he go?

          EXT. PRESS STAGE - LATER
                         
          Post race press conference. Francesco is center stage.
                         
                          DARRELL CARTRIP
           Francesco, over here! Hey, what was
           your strategy today?
                         
                          FRANCESCO
           Strategia? Francesco needs no
           strategy, it's very simple. You
           start the race, wait for Lightning
           McQueen to choke, pass him, then
           win. Francesco always wins. It's
           boring.
                         
          McQueen, waiting in the wings, rolls his eyes. He suddenly
          notices something O.S.
                         
          McQueen's P.O.V. - It's MATER, appearing from a side street,
          moving toward the pits, oblivious of the press conference.
                         
                          DARRELL CARTRIP
                          (TO FRANCESCO)
           I gotta tell you, dude. You were in
           trouble for awhile. That dirt track
           section had you crawling!
                         
          As McQueen SNEAKS AWAY ---
                         
                          FRANCESCO
           To truly crush one's dream, you
           must first raise their hopes very
           high.
                         
          IN MCQUEEN'S PIT GARAGE - Mater looks around for everyone as
          McQueen approaches.

                          MATER
          Hey McQueen! What happened? Is the
          race over? You won, right?
                         
                          MCQUEEN
          Mater, why were you yelling things
          at me while I was racing?
                         
                          MATER
          Yelling? Oh, you thought... that's
          funny right there. Nah, see that's
          `cause I seen these two fellers
          doing some sort of karate street
          performance. It was nutso. One of
          them even had a flamethrower ---
                         
                          MCQUEEN
          A flamethrower? What are you
          talking about? I don't understand.
          Where were you?
                         
                          MATER
          Going to meet my date.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
          Your date?
                         
                          MATER
          She started talking to me as a
          voice in my head, telling me where
          to go ---
                         
                          MCQUEEN
          What?
                         
                          MATER
          Wait a minute -- I didn't screw you
          up, did I?
                         
                          MCQUEEN
          I lost the race because of you!
                         
                          MATER
          Well, I'm sorry. I didn't mean ---
                         
                          MCQUEEN
          An imaginary girlfriend,
          flamethrowers. This is exactly why
          I don't bring you along to these
          things.
           53.
                         
                         
                          MATER
           Maybe if I, I don't know, talked to
           somebody and explained what
           happened I could help.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           I don't need your help. I don't
           want your help.
                         
           PRESS (O.S.)
           Hey, there he is!!
                         
          The press finds McQueen, swarms him. Mater is pushed
          backwards as the questions fly again.
                         
                          PRESS
           - McQueen, you had it in the bag!
           - Yeah, what happened?
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           I made a mistake. But I can assure
           you, it won't happen again.
                         
          On Mater. He takes this badly.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Look, guys. We know what the
           problem is and we've taken care of
           it.

           lap to Francesco Bernoulli in the
           first race of the World Grand Prix
           and three, count em, three cars
           flamed out leading some to suggest
           that their fuel, Allinol, might be
           to blame.

           Allinol is safe! Alternative fuel
           is safe! There is no way my fuel
           caused these cars to flame out!

           Well the jury may still be out on
           whether Allinol caused these
           accidents, but one thing's for
           sure: Lightning McQueen blew this
           race.

          A SECURITY CAR approaches Mater.
                         
                          SECURITY CAR

          IN THE ADMIRAL'S LOUNGE - MOMENTS LATER. The Security Car
          leads Mater inside.
                         
                          SECURITY CAR
           Right this way.
                         
          As they move past us the Security Car covertly drops a BALL
          BEARING which rolls into a corner. The ball bearing then
          sprouts MECHANICAL LEGS, tripods itself and IRISES out,
          revealing itself to be a tiny CAMERA.

           Doggone it. This is about my hook,
           isn't it? I know I should've
           checked it, but I can't really,
           look -- it's attached to me.
                         
          ZWAPPPPPP!! The Security Car suddenly DECLOAKS himself,
          reveals himself to be Finn McMissile!
                         
                          MATER
           Hey, I know you. You're that feller
           from the karate demonstration.
                         
                          FINN
           I never properly introduced myself.

           Let's just say I'm triple-A
           affiliated. You know, I know some
           karate. I don't wanna brag or
           nothing, but I've got me a black
           fan belt.
                         
          BEEP! Finn's rearview alarms. His camera has picked up Grem
          and Acer. They've just entered the lounge, are right around
          the corner.
                         
                          MATER

           made up?

           You're being followed.
                         
          Finn quickly turns, fires a tiny GLASS CUTTING BEETLE at the
          window. As Mater talks, oblivious, the beetle cuts out a
          round hole.
                         
                          MATER
           This first one I can reach into a
           car's hood, pull out his battery,
           and show it to him before he
           stalls. I call it, "What I
           accidentally did to my friend Luigi
           once."

                          MATER

           This is First Class service. You
           don't even have to go through the
           terminal.
                         
          ACER and GREM appear, chasing them. Mater, who is facing
          backward as he is being pulled along, faces them. They're
          about a hundred yards back.

           don't stop.
                         
          Finn SKIDS around, whipping Mater in a 180 so that Mater is

          DRIVES ITSELF toward Grem, anchors itself under his frame and
          flips him like a turtle but not before Grem gets the rocket

           Is everything okay back there?
                         
           SIDDELEY (O.S.)
           Finn, it's Sid. I'm on approach.
                         
          A GULFSTREAM JET wings into view overhead. This is SIDDELEY.
                         
                          FINN
           Roger that.
                         
          Mater looks up: ACER screeches into view up ahead, dragging a
          long row of luggage carts in Mater's path, attempting to
          create an accident.
                         
                          MATER
                          (TO FINN)
           You remember that whole thing about
           me not stopping no matter what?
                         
          Just as it looks dire --- RATATATATATATAT!!! SIDDELEY
          descends, hawklike, fires bullets and blows the luggage carts
          sky-high. Mater and Finn burst through them, luggage now
          raining down from above.
                         
                          MATER
           I knew I should've done carry-on!
                         
                          FINN
                          (TO SIDDELEY)
           Thanks, old boy!
                         
          Siddeley LANDS HARD on the tarmac ahead of them. No time to
          stop, he DROPS his back open, revealing HOLLEY.
                         
                          MATER
           Hey, doggone it. It's my imaginary
           girlfriend!
                         
                          HOLLEY
           Come on! Get in here!
           58.
                         
                         
          Mater SPEEDS UP toward Siddeley's ramp, Holley.
                         
                          MATER
                          (TO HOLLEY)
           Boy I tell you what, you really do
           want this first date, don't ya?
           That's a no-quit attitude right
           there.
                         
          Just as Mater's wheels touch the ramp, BULLETS PING around
          him in a spray. Siddeley is HIT, a tire BLOWN. He yells in
          pain.
                         
                          FINN
           Hold on, Sid!
                         
          Siddeley peels off the runway onto the grass.
                         
          A gunfight ensues between Finn and Acer. Finn SHOOTS ACER'S
          TIRE, blowing it and throwing him off-course.
                         
          Acer CAREENS out of control, drives up and THROUGH A JET ---
                         
          --- OUT THE OTHER SIDE where he lands in an oil tanker.
                         
          ON SIDDELEY - He's headed toward the edge of the tarmac,
          where the grass and runway meet WATER. He HITS THE GAS, his
          only hope.
                         
                          SIDDELEY
           Finn, it's now or never!
                         
          Finn BRAKES, 180s and grabs the ramp just as Siddeley gets
          air.
                         
                          SIDDELEY
           Hold on!
                         
          Mater, the only thing not in the jet, dangles and recedes
          from our view as Siddeley climbs toward the clouds. As he's
          PULLED in through the back hatch:
                         
           MATER (V.O.)
           By the time you read this, I will
           be safely on an airplane, flying
           home.
                         
          INT. LOBBY - HOTEL - TOKYO - DAY
                         
          CLOSE ON a handwritten (er, tire-written?) NOTE in childish
          scrawl. We don't see all of it, only a bit. Mater's voice
          O.S. begins the note with the first sentence, but we DISSOLVE
          into McQueen's voice.
           59.
                         
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           "I'm so sorry for what I did. I
           don't want to be the cause of you

           already know - that you are the
           greatest race car in the whole wide
           world. Your best friend, Mater."
                         
          McQueen takes this in.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           I didn't really want him to leave.

          INT. JET - DAY
                         
          A well-appointed spy jet. Various computers line the walls.
                         
                          FINN
           Now that's how I like to start the
           day! You never feel more alive than

                          HOLLEY
                          (SCANNING MATER)
           I hope that device didn't fall off.
                         
                          MATER
           That's the closest I ever been to
           missing my flight! That was ---
           60.
                         
                         
          With a ROBOTIC ARM, Holley grabs the THE DEVICE that Rod
          Redline hid under Mater. She yanks it out with a GOOSE.
                         
                          MATER
                          (JUMPS)
           Yow!
                         
                          HOLLEY
           Still in one piece, great.
                         
          Holley drops the device into a mainframe computer. It starts
          "ANALYZING."
                         
                          MATER
           I gotta go to a doctor. I keep
           getting these sharp pains in my
           undercarriage.

           Downloading the photo now.
                         
                          MATER
           Hey, lemme introduce you two.
                          (TO HOLLEY)
           This here is Finn McSomething-or-
           other. He's a First Class VIP
           airport whatchamacallit. And Finn,
           this here's my date.
                          (TO HOLLEY)
           I never did get your name.
                         
                          HOLLEY
           Oh yes, sorry. It's Shiftwell.
           Holley Shiftwell.
                         
                          MATER
                          (TO FINN)
           It's Shiftwell. Holley ---
                         
          DING! The computer is done analyzing. The cabin lights dim.
                         
                          FINN
           Finally. Time to see who's behind
           all this.
                         
          AN IMAGE is blasted between the three of them. It's of a
          photograph, a complicated melange of metallic parts stuck
          together.
                         
                          HOLLEY
           (to Mater, expectantly)
           What is this?
           61.
                         
                         
                          MATER
           Well, that's one of the worst
           engines ever made. It's an old
           aluminum V8 with a Lucas electrical
           system and Whitworth bolts. Shoot,
           them Whitworth bolts is a pain,
           tell you what. Them ain't metric,
           they ain't inches...
                         
                          HOLLEY
           Yes, OK, right. But who's engine is
           this, Mater?
                         
                          MATER
           Well, it's kinda hard to tell from
           this picture, ain't it?
                         
                          HOLLEY
           But you're the one who took it.
                         
                          FINN
           Holley.
                         
                          HOLLEY
           Oh, right. Yes, of course. "A good
           agent gets what he can, then gets
           out before he's killed." Sorry.
                         
                          MATER
           Agent? You mean like insurance
           agent, like,
                          (SINGS)
           `Like a good neighbor, Mater is
           there'? Wait, you mean secret
           agents. You guys is spies!
                         
                          FINN
           Holley, in how many makes and
           models did this type of engine
           appear?
                         
          Holley has these stats in seconds. Kid's play.
                         
                          HOLLEY
           It was standard in seven models
           over a 12-year period. At least
           35,000 cars were made with this
           engine.
                         
          Mater MOVES HIS SEAT FORWARD, through one part of the
          hologram so he's face-to-face with Holley.
                         
                          MATER
           You're pretty.
           62.
                         
                         
                          HOLLEY
                          (ANNOYED)
           Yes, alright. Thank you.
                         
                          MATER
           And so nice.
                         
                          HOLLEY
           Just pay attention.
                         
          She moves the engine photo so it's now blocking Mater again.
                         
                          FINN
           This seems like a dead end. If
           there were something in the photo
           that could narrow this down a bit
           I'd be a lot happier.
                         
                          MATER
           You might not be happy, but I bet
           this feller is. See how he's had
           most of his parts replaced? And see
           all them boxes over there? Them's
           all original parts. They ain't easy
           to come by.
                         
                          HOLLEY
           Rare parts.
                         
                          FINN
           That's something we can track.
                         
                          HOLLEY
           Exactly!
                         
          Holley drops her screen down.
                         
                          FINN
           Well done, Mater! I would never
           have seen that.
                          (TO HOLLEY)
           I know of a black-market parts
           dealer in Paris, a treacherous
           lowlife. But, he's the only car in
           the world who can tell us whose
           engine this is. Mater, what would
           you say to setting up an informal
           task force on this one?
                         
                          MATER
           Wait, what?
           63.
                         
                         
                          FINN
           You obviously have plenty of
           experience in the field.
                         
                          MATER
           Well yeah I live right next to one.
           (thinks about it)
           I don't know, Finn. I ain't exactly
           been much help to anybody recently.
                         
                          FINN
           You're helping me. Please, Mater.
                         
                          MATER
           Well, okay. But you know I'm just a
           tow truck, right?
                         
                          FINN
           Right. And I'm just in the
           import/export business. Siddeley?
                         
                          SIDDELEY
           Yes, Finn?
                         
                          FINN
           Paris. Tout de suite.
                         
                          MATER
           Yeah, two of them sweets for me
           too, Sid!
                          (TO HOLLEY)
           You know, I always wanted to be a
           spy.
                         
                          HOLLEY
                          (SMILING SWEETLY)
           Really? Me too.
                         
                          SIDDELEY
           Afterburners, sir?
                         
                          FINN
           Is there any other way?
                         
          EXT. JET - MOVING
                         
          Siddeley HITS THE JUICE, they kick forward like a mule as we
          CUT TO ---
                         
          A MONTAGE OF PARIS: Mater attempts to merge into roundabout
          traffic; mimes annoy tourists at the Eiffel Tower; a painter
          works his magic on an unattractive couple; a couple kisses on
          the most romantic spot in the world; we might even catch
          GASTOW'S RESTAURANT.
           64.
                         
                         
          The charming, low-key introduction ends with a SWEEPING VISTA
          of Paris's center from far away as we CRANE DOWN INTO ---
                         
          EXT. STREET - DAY
                         
          --- a dirty street in the 1st Arrondissement. Finn and Holley
          drive along together as Mater, playing "spy," darts back and
          forth behind them from doorway to dumpster, "hiding out."
          He's having a ball.
                         
                          FINN
                          (TO HOLLEY)
           Once we're inside, stay close.
           Don't bother checking VIN numbers
           for criminal records, they're all
           dodgy here.
                         
                          HOLLEY
           No VIN scans. Got it.
                         
                          FINN
           Don't talk to anyone. Don't look at
           anyone. And absolutely, positively
           no idling. Are we clear?
                         
                          HOLLEY
           Yes, right. No idling. Yes, sir.
                         
                          FINN
           Mater?
                         
                          MATER
           Yeah, Finn?
                         
                          FINN
           We're not here to go shopping.
                         
          As Finn and Holley and Mater turn the corner...
                         
                          MATER
           Shopping? What do you mean? Why
           would I ---
                         
          Mater turns the corner and enters a massive Les Halles-
          inspired Parisian market filled with car parts. A tow truck's
          dream.
                         
                          MATER

          IN THE MARKET - MOMENTS LATER
                         
          Mater rolls along, impressed by the goods for sale.
                         
                          MATER
           You gotta be kidding me - they've
           got everything here. Look at them
           hoods! I could use a hood.
                         
          Mater continues on though, heeding Finn's advice.
                         
                          MATER
           Sorry fellers, I gotta go.
                         
          INT. ENCLOSED MARKETPLACE - DAY
                         
          Mater, now out of sight of Finn and Holley, passes a darkened
          stall. He STOPS, peers in. There's someone in there.
                         
                          MATER
           Excuse me. What are you selling?
                         
          It suddenly OPENS its headlights revealing... EYES!! In
          French, the mutant car pitches his wares to Mater. Mater
          FREAKS OUT, speeds off, TERRIFIED.
                         
          AROUND THE CORNER - FINN AND HOLLEY
                         
          A few car lengths ahead of Mater. They roll along, looking
          for... Aha! Finn and Holley recede into the shadows.
                         
          In FINN'S SIDE MIRROR: TOMBER, a three-wheeled parts dealer,
          argues with a French customer.
                         
                          FINN
           There you are.
                         
          Mater suddenly turns the corner, sees Finn and Holley.
                         
                          MATER
           Man, there are some great ---
                         
                          FINN
           Mater, get back!
                         
          Too late. Tomber sees Mater, then notices FINN, reflected in
          a hubcap. He BOLTS. Finn and Holley give chase.
                         
                          MATER
           Hey, wait for me!
                         
          Tomber, skidding away, kicks a tent in Finn's way. Holley
          quickly pivots RIGHT and disappears. Where did she go?
           66.
                         
                         
          Finn, hot in pursuit, leaps another obstacle and loses ground
                         TO ---
                         
          --- Tomber who turns a corner and finds himself grill to
          grill with HOLLEY. He whips to the left but TURNS OVER,
          rolling sideways and CRASHING to a stop.
                         
          Holley ZAPS him with ELECTROSHOCKERS. Finn suddenly arrives,
          stops her.
                         
                          FINN
                          (TO HOLLEY)
           Have you lost your mind?!
                         
                          HOLLEY
           But I thought ---
                         
                          FINN
           Mater! This chap needs a tow. Hook
           him up.
                         
                          MATER
           Sure thing.
                          CUT TO:
                         
          MOMENTS LATER - Mater tows Tomber, following Finn and Holley.
                         
                          TOMBER
           You rusty piece of junk, get your
           dirty hook off me!
                         
          INT. A SMALL GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER
                         
          Finn throws open a door. Cars scatter like cockroaches.
                         
                          FINN
           (to the cars)
           Allez! Maintenant - vite!
                         
          Mater unhooks an angry Tomber who spits in French. Finn pulls
          the door down. As it LATCHES TIGHT ---
                         
                          TOMBER
                          (TO FINN)
           Electroshock! Are you kidding me??
                         
                          FINN
           Easy, Tomber. This is her first
           field assignment - she didn't know
           you were my informant.
                         
                          HOLLEY
           Informant?
           67.
                         
                         
                          TOMBER
           A rookie, eh? I never liked new car-
           smell.
                         
          Holley FUMES with anger.
                         
                          FINN
           Tomber was doing 20 to life in a
           Moroccan impound the first time I
           saved him, if I recall correctly.
                         
                          TOMBER
           Speaking of recalls, you're getting
           up there in mileage aren't you,
           Finn?
                         
                          HOLLEY
           Alright, we get it. You both know
           each other, you're both old. So.
                         
          Holley shoots a HOLOGRAPHIC PHOTO of the engine in front of
          Tomber.
                         
                          HOLLEY
           There you go, informant. Inform us.
                         
          Tomber eyes the photo. He recoils, unimpressed.
                         
                          TOMBER
           That is the worst motor ever made.
                         
          Suddenly, Tomber narrows his gaze.
                         
                          TOMBER
           Wait. That oil filter... those
           wheel bearings.
                         
                          FINN
           Do those parts look familiar,
           Tomber?
                         
                          TOMBER
           They should. I sold them.
                         
                          HOLLEY
           To whom?
                         
                          TOMBER
           No idea. He's my best customer, but
           he always does his business over
           the phone. I was always wondering
           why he needs so many parts. Now I
           know.
           68.
                         
                         
                          MATER
           Well, a lemon needs parts. Ain't
           nothing truer than that.
                         
                          FINN
           "Lemon?"
                         
                          MATER
           Yeah, you know. Cars that don't
           ever work right. Lemons is a tow
           truck's bread and butter. Like them
           Gremlins and Pacers we run into at
           the party and the race and the
           airport.
                         
                          FINN
           Holley, pull up the pictures from
           the oil platform. I want to know
           what other type of cars were out
           there.
                         
          Holley complies and suddenly PHOTOS OF CARS FROM THE OIL
          PLATFORM hang suspended in the air in front of them.
                         
                          HOLLEY
           Right. Let's see. There were Hugos.
           And Trunkovs.
                         
                          FINN
           Mater, are these cars considered
           lemons?
                         
                          MATER
           Is the Popemobile Catholic?
                         
                          HOLLEY
           Finn. Everyone involved in this
           plot is one of history's biggest
           loser cars.
                         
          Holley refers to the ENGINE PHOTO, which now rises forward as
          the prominent picture, perhaps the only one in view.
                         
                          FINN
           And they're all taking their orders
           from the car behind this engine.
                         
                          TOMBER
           This explains it!
                         
                          FINN
           What, Tomber?
           69.
                         
                         
                          TOMBER
           Gremlin, Pacer, Hugo and Trunkovs
           never get together. But they're
           having a secret meeting in two
           days.
                         
                          FINN
           Where's this meeting taking place?
                         
                          TOMBER
           Porto Corsa, Italy.
                         
                          MATER
           That's where the next race is!
                         
                          FINN
           Then there's a good chance our
           mystery engine will be there too.
                         
                          TOMBER
           Your chances are more than good. I
           just sent him a new clutch assembly
           yesterday... to Porto Corsa.

           Holley, contact Stephenson and have
           him meet us at Gare de Lyon. Good
           work.
                         
          EXT. FRENCH ALPS - NIGHT
                         
          STEPHENSON, a THREE-CAR LUXURY BULLET TRAIN speeds along a
          snow-covered mountain in the dead of night, its halogen
          headlight cutting through the darkness. It DIPS into a
                         TUNNEL ---
                         
           MATER (O.S.)
           Boy, I'll tell you what. That three-
           wheeled feller had to be right
           about a big meeting.
                         
          INT. SPY CAR - MOVING - NIGHT
                         
          Mater, Finn and Holley scroll through surveillance-style
          photos of TRAFFIC on an Italian street. They're in the front
          train car, which doubles as a luxury seating area and
          intelligence command center.
                         
                          MATER
           You never see this many lemons in
           one town. Unless there's a swap
           meet, or something.

           70.
                         
                          MATER (CONT'D)
           Hey, how'd you get all them
           pictures?
                         
                          HOLLEY
           Well, I remotely reprogrammed Porto
           Corsa's red light cameras to do
           recognition scans.
                         
                          MATER
           Wow, not only is you the prettiest
           car I ever met, but you the
           smartest too.
                         
                          HOLLEY
           Thank you. I think.
                         
                          MATER
           That's a familiar sight.
                         
          Mater refers to a photo of VICTOR HUGO, the HUGO Lemonhead,
          being towed by an EASTERN EUROPEAN TOW TRUCK.
                         
                          MATER
           A Hugo being towed. But he looks
           absolutely perfect.
                         
                          FINN
           Of course. They must be the heads
           of the lemon families.
                         
                          MATER
           Makes sense. If I was rich and
           broke down every day, I'd hire me
           to tow me around all the time too.
                         
                          FINN
           We've got to infiltrate that
           meeting. It's the only way to find
           out who's behind all this.
                         
                          HOLLEY
                          (EYEING MATER)
           Hang on a minute.
                         
                          MATER
           What?
                         
                          HOLLEY
           Hold still.
                         
          Holley SNAPS Mater's picture, temporarily blinding him.
                         
                          MATER
           Ahh!
           71.
                         
                         
          Holley turns back to her monitor. Mater's face appears on
          screen. She quickly GRAFTS it over the Hugo's tow truck's.
                         
                          FINN
           Good job, Miss Shiftwell.
                         
          Holley isn't sure what surprises her more: the compliment or
          how pleased it makes her.
                         
                          HOLLEY
           Thank you, Finn.
                         
                          MATER
           Boy, I sure wish my friends could
           see me now.
                         
          EXT. SMALL TOWN - ITALY - OUTSIDE PORTO CORSA - DAY
                         
          A quaint Italian piazza. A pristine MASERATI FOUNTAIN,
          complete with ancient trident, looms in our view.
                         
          Luigi and Guido roll into view.
                         
                          LUIGI
           Guido, your eyes do not deceive
           you. We are in Italy. We are home!
                         
          Sarge, Fillmore and McQueen exit a WGP transport truck.
                         
                          FILLMORE
           Hey, Luigi. Which way to the hotel,
           man?
                         
                          LUIGI
           What? No friends of mine will stay
           in a hotel in my village. You will
           stay with my --- Uncle Topolino!
                         
          UNCLE TOPOLINO, a distinguished 1937 Fiat Topolino, rolls
          forward. He greets them warmly with affectionate Italian
          salutations as word of Guido and Luigi's arrival spreads. The
          square FILLS with family and friends.
                         
          EXT. PIAZZA - DUSK
                         
          A festive homecoming party. Lights strung across the square.
          Music and dancing. Fillmore and Sarge are at a dining table.
                         
                          SARGE
           How do they do it? These are the
           same ingredients as back home, but
           it tastes so good.
           72.
                         
                         
                          FILLMORE
           It's organic, man.
                         
                          SARGE
           Tree hugger.
                         
          LIGHTNING MCQUEEN rolls along the periphery of the square,
          seems lost in thought.
                         
           UNCLE TOPOLINO (O.S.)
           Race car.
                         
          Uncle Topolino beckons McQueen over.
                         
                          UNCLE TOPOLINO
           You look so down, so low. Is like
           you have flat tires.
                         
          MAMA TOPOLINO, a hefty Italian grandmother pipes up, a mile a
          minute then drives off, now a car on a mission.
                         
                          UNCLE TOPOLINO
           She said you look like you're
           starving. That she's going to make
           you a big meal, and fatten you up.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           No, Mama Topolino, please. You
           don't need to make a fuss!
                         
          Too late. She's disappeared inside her kitchen.
                         
                          UNCLE TOPOLINO
           Capisco. I understand. Is a
           problem, yes? Between you and a
           friend?
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           How'd you know that?
                         
                          UNCLE TOPOLINO
           A wise car hears one word and
           understands two.
                         
          McQueen takes this in, impressed.
                         
                          UNCLE TOPOLINO
           That, and Luigi told me. While Mama
           cooks, come and take a stroll with
           me.
                         
          They amble forward, Uncle Topolino setting the pace.
           73.
                         
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           I brought my friend Mater along on
           the trip. And I told him he needed
           to act different, that we weren't
           in Radiator Springs.
                         
                          UNCLE TOPOLINO
           This Mater. He's a close friend?
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           He's my best friend.
                         
                          UNCLE TOPOLINO
           Then why would you ask him to be
           someone else?
                         
          McQueen considers this - a realization.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           What did I do? I said some things
           during our fight...
                         
                          UNCLE TOPOLINO
           You know, back when Guido and Luigi
           used to work for me, they would
           fight over everything.
                         
          IN THE SQUARE - Guido dances with a girl. Luigi suddenly CUTS
          IN. They begin to ARGUE.
                         
                          UNCLE TOPOLINO
           They fight over what Ferrari was
           the best Ferrari; which one of
           them look more like a Ferrari...
           There were even some non-Ferrari
           fights.
                         
          Guido now LIFTS Luigi, cuts BACK in.
                         
                          UNCLE TOPOLINO
           So I tell them, va bene. It's okay
           to fight. Everybody fights now and
           then, especially best friends.
                         
          McQueen takes this in. Seems to take some small comfort.
                         
                          UNCLE TOPOLINO
           But you gotta make up fast.
                         
          McQueen's comfort quickly evaporates.
                         
                          UNCLE TOPOLINO
           No fight more important than
           friendship.
           74.
                         
                         
          Guido and Luigi now dance together with the girl and her
          friend who has just arrived. All having a great time. They
          dance past us, crossing in front of MCQUEEN AND UNCLE
          TOPOLINO. We STAY WITH them.
                         
                          UNCLE TOPOLINO
           Chi trova un'amico, trova un
           tesoro.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           What does that mean?
                         
                          MAMA TOPOLINO
                          (ARRIVING)
           Whoever find a friend, find a
           treasure.
                         
          Mama Topolino drops a tray of food in front of McQueen.
                         
                          MAMA TOPOLINO
           Now, mangia! Eat!
                         
          ON MCQUEEN, distant, taking all of this in, lost in thought
          as, in the background, Uncle Topolino and Mama Topolino talk,
          then argue, then make up (all in Italian) all while we stay
          on McQueen's pensive face ---

          Holley turns back to her work. The disguise's cloaking is
          larger than Mater. As a result, Holley must dial it back to
          fit his body. As she carefully calibrates the hologram:

          She deploys A BONDO SPRAYER on a robotic arm, moves it toward
          one of Mater's DENTS. Mater pulls away.

          IVAN, AN EASTERN EUROPEAN TOW TRUCK (the one Holley and Finn
          prepped Mater to impersonate), drives forward.
                         
           IVAN THE TOW TRUCK
           Sounds like you need some "roadside
           assistance".
                         
                          ANOTHER HUGO
           She was talking to me, Ivan.

           Oh really? Prove it.
                         
                          HOLLEY
           No, no, don't fight over me.
                         
          Holley directs her interest toward Ivan.

           Signore Tow Truck, per favore?

          MATER - He watches this from a safe hiding spot around a
          corner.
                         
           FINN (V.O.)
           Get ready, Mater.
                          CUT TO:
                         
          FINN, at an outdoor cafe on the casino grounds.
                         
                          FINN
           You're on any moment now.
           CUT BACK TO:
                         
          MATER, now looking a bit nervous. He backs out of sight.
                         
                          MATER
           I don't know about this, Finn.
           What if I screw things up?
                         
           FINN (OVER RADIO)
           Impossible. Just apply the same
           level of dedication you've been
           using to play the "idiot tow truck"
           and you'll be fine.
                         
                          MATER
           It's just that them guys look
           pretty tough and --- Wait, did you
           say "idiot"? Is that how you see
           me?
                         
           FINN (OVER RADIO)
           That's how everyone sees you. Isn't
           that the idea? I tell you, that's
           the genius of it. No one realizes
           they're being fooled because
           they're too busy laughing at the
           fool. Brilliant.
                         
          While Finn talks, Mater takes this in. He catches his own
          reflection in a nearby window. Seems to be seeing himself
          with new eyes.
           83.

                          ALEXANDER HUGO
           It's the boss! He is coming!
                         
          The carrier parks and the back opens. VICTOR HUGO waits.
                         
                          VICTOR HUGO
           Ivan!
                         
          Mater realizes Victor is talking to him. He hops to it.
                         
                          VICTOR HUGO
           Ivan, why do you insult me so by
           making me wait?
                         
          Mater, now with Victor hooked, tows him in the front doors of
          the casino.
                         
          ON FINN - now joined in the cafe by Holley who monitors
          everything and SEES EVERYTHING MATER SEES on her display.
                         
                          HOLLEY

          corners by Hugo thugs, ala a presidential motorcade. The
          largess of the interior design seems to finally snap Mater
          out of his funk.
                         
                          MATER

           Wow, this place looks like it's
           made out of gold.
                         
          The Hugos on either side of Mater exchange a look.
                         
           HOLLEY (OVER RADIO)
           That's because it is, Mater. Now,
           be careful what you say.
                         
                          MATER
           Why is that? What do you mean don't
           talk to you?
           (more talking from Holley
           which we cannot hear)
           So you want me to stop talking to

          Alexander Hugo, unaware of Holley's interruption, whispers to
          Mater as they turn a corner.

           same mistake twice.
                         
          On Mater. He takes this in.

           So a surprising revelation from
           Lightning McQueen...
                         
          Zundapp is already on the phone with their Big Boss who,
          based on his angry O.S. voice, sounds ticked off.
                         
                          PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
           Yes, sir. Of course.
                         
          Zundapp hangs up, turns to the room.
                         
                          PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
           Allinol must be finished for good.
           McQueen cannot win the last race.
           Lightning McQueen must be killed.
                         
          Mater's eyes open wide.
                         
                          MATER
           No!
                         
          Mater backs up, KNOCKING his emergency light against one of
          the monitors. ZZZZZAT! His holographic disguise flickers away
          then quickly SCROLLS THROUGH all of his previous disguises,
          finally revealing rusty old Mater.
                         
                          PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
           It's the American spy!

                          MATER

          The Lemons and Lemonheads hit the deck and RETURN FIRE ---
                         
          Mater is THROWN BACKWARD by the force of the guns, back
          through some double doors and onto a BALCONY.
                         
                          MATER

          catches air and is YANKED INTO THE SKY!
                         
          The Lemonheads watch him float away, amazed.
                         
          ON MATER, out of the frying pan but still toasty. He looks
          around, notices:
                         
          LIGHTNING MCQUEEN, far away, leaving the press podium.
                         
                          MATER
           McQueen!
                         
          Mater looks down at the harbor, over which he flies. He spots
          a MOTORBOAT. Mater WHIPS his hook down, steals a ride behind
          the boat TOWARD MCQUEEN.
           96.

          The motorboat isn't happy about this, tries to shake him.
          Mater is THROWN INTO A "HOTEL" sign, then SMASHES down
          through a Francesco souvenir stand. As he CRASHES onto the
          ground hard, we SMASH CUT TO ---

           Lemme through! Lemme through!
                         
          MATER barrels around a corner. He's now covered in Francesco
          memorabilia and palm leaves. The word `HOT' now dangles off
          him like the world's biggest bling. He looks INSANE.
                         
                          MATER
                          (TO SECURITY)

           through to warn McQueen!

          Mater spots McQueen far off in the distance.
                         
                          MATER
           McQueen! McQueen!

          McQueen looks up but can only see A SEA OF VEHICLES,
          flashbulbs, cameras, TV trucks with those tall satellite
          antennae things that spindle toward the sky...
                         
          BACK AT THE SECURITY BARRICADE - Mater, like a nimble running
          back, dances around to avoid capture by security.
                         
                          MATER

           Back up, sir. Stop moving! Stop!
                         
          Mater head fakes them and pushes through, into the crowd ---
                         
                          ITALIAN SECURITY #1
           Oy! Stop! Ferma li!

          in the back.
                         
                          MATER

           That really sounded like Mater.
           Mater?
                         
                          PRESS LIAISON
                          (TO MCQUEEN)
           Signore...
                         
          ON MATER, getting CLOSER...
                         
                          MATER
           McQueen, they're gonna kill you!!
                         
          ON MCQUEEN - Okay, he's positive that was his friend, but
          where is he?
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Mater?!
                         
          McQueen spots a TOW HOOK, moving through the crowd toward
          him, "Jaws"-like.
           98.
                         
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Excuse me.
                         
          McQueen disappears into the press crowd.
                         
                          PRESS LIAISON
           No, no, where are you going?
           Please, Mr. McQueen!
                         
          McQueen pushes through the press.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Scusi. Mater! Scusi...
                         
          McQueen tracks the tow hook, gets closer. He pushes through
          the last few vehicles ---
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Mater, I'm so glad to see you. I'm
           so sorr ---
                         
          It's NOT MATER. It's IVAN, the Hugo Thug's tow truck.
                         
           IVAN THE TOW TRUCK
           Lightning McQueen! I am a huge fan.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
                          (CONFUSED)
           Oh, I'm sorry. I thought I heard---
                         
           IVAN THE TOW TRUCK
           Yes, but that was me. I said, "You
           killed out there today." You're
           the best.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           What? Oh. I mean, thanks.
                         
                          PRESS LIAISON
           Right this way, signore ---
                         
          Now the Press Liaison and his assistants are pushing McQueen
          back in the other direction ---
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           (as he's pulled away)
           I really thought I heard my friend.
                         
          As he's pulled away, press and onlookers start to come
          between him and Ivan, who hasn't moved.
           99.
                         
                         
           IVAN THE TOW TRUCK
                          (TO MCQUEEN)
           In England you'll be finished. At
           the finish line.
                         
          Ivan is now obscured again.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Wait, what?
                         
          The ITALIAN PRESS being to swarm.

          McQueen is pulled back ---
                         
          EXT. STREET - PORTO CORSA - MOMENTS LATER
                         
          --- just as Mater, now BOUND and with HIS MOUTH TAPED, is
          pulled away and thrown into the back of a transport vehicle.
          He lands hard on his side, spits out his TAPE.
                         
                          MATER
           Let me go!
                         
                          PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
           You actually care about that race
           car. A pity you didn't warn him in
           time.
                         
          As the doors close on Mater --- PHHHHHSSSSSSTTTTTTT! A
          thick, noxious gas starts to fill the truck.
                         
          On MATER as the knockout gas works its magic. HIS EYES CLOSE.

          FADE IN on Mater, back at the Casino, eyeing his reflection
          in the glass window. It's the same moment from before except
          now we are watching it from a DETACHED, FLOATING PERSPECTIVE.

          makes a spectacle of himself, WHOOPING AND HOLLERING in the

          McQueen, Fillmore, Guido, Luigi, Sarge and patrons eye Mater,
          embarrassed and angry.
                         
          - IN THE JAPANESE MUSEUM - The moment of Mater banging on the
          Zen rock garden's glass. Except that now we see all sorts of

                          MCQUEEN
                          (HUMILIATED)
           Will you guys excuse me just for
           one little second?
                         
          We now REVEAL that this FLOATING, THIRD PERSON PERSPECTIVE is
          MATER. He's INSIDE his past, watching it from others' points
          of view. He doesn't like what he sees.
                         
          - ON MATER, now at the sushi bar.
                         
                          MATER
           Now that's a scoop of ice cream!
                         
          Mater swallows the wasabi with one big bite. He SCREAMS! The
          sushi bar patrons blanch with revulsion at his wail.
                         
          - ON THE FOUNTAIN, as Mater peels into full view of everyone
          else at the party. As Mater laps up water from a fountain:
                         
                          MCQUEEN
                          (EMBARRASSED)
           Mater?!
           101.
                         
                         
          ALL THE RACERS, with FRANCESCO front and center, guffaw at
          Mater.
                         
          - On MCQUEEN, now scolding Mater moments later.
                         
                          MATER
           I never leak oil. Never.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Mater, you have to get a hold of
           yourself. You're making a scene!
                         
          - IN MCQUEEN'S PIT GARAGE, after the Japanese race.
                         
                          MATER
           Wait a minute. I didn't screw you
           up, did I?
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           I lost the race because of you!
                         
                          MATER
           Maybe if I talked to somebody, or---
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           I don't need your help. I don't
           want your help!
                         
          - Now BACK AT THE PARTY, a moment we didn't see before but
          which presumably happened. Mater is BANGING a ceremonial
          GONG, to the horror of Japanese guests.
                         
                          MATER
           Bang a gong, get it on!
                         
          GONNNNNNG!!! ---
                         
          On the PARTYGOERS, RACE CARS, PARTY STAFF - they're all
          laughing at Mater as McQueen's final words blend in, making a
                         DISSATISFIED CACOPHONY
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Listen, this isn't Radiator
           Springs. This is exactly why I
           don't bring you along to these
           things!
                         
          Off the GONG at the party ---
                         
          INT. BIG BENTLEY - DAY
                         
          --- to the GONG of a CLOCK.
                         
          CLOSE ON MATER as he OPENS HIS EYES.
           102.
                         
                         
          All around him, all he sees are GIANT PIECES OF MECHANIZED
          CLOCKWORK.
                         
          HOLLEY and FINN are here too, strapped bumper to bumper in
          the divots of large clock movements.
                         
                          MATER
           Holley! Finn! Where are we?
                         
                          FINN
           We're in London, Mater. Inside Big
           Bentley.
                         
          EXT. BIG BENTLEY - CONTINUOUS
                         
          The BIG HAND finishes ADVANCING one minute. It's 3 PM.
                         
          INT. BIG BENTLEY - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Suddenly Mater DROPS QUICKLY down toward ---
                         
          --- whirring, scary machinery.
                         
                          MATER
           Woaaaah! ---
                         
          WHAP! The chain yanks to a STOP.
                         
          Mater, instead of being 30 feet from death, is now 20.
                         
          Finn and Holley are only a few clicks closer to being crushed
          themselves. The clock ticks to 3:01.
                         
                          MATER
           This... this is all my fault.
                         
                          FINN
           Don't be a fool, Mater.
                         
                          MATER
           But I am, remember? You said so.
                         
                          FINN
           When did I... Oh. Mater, I was
           complimenting you on what a good
           spy you are.
                         
                          MATER
           I'm not a spy!
                         
          This echoes throughout the clock.
           103.
                         
                         
                          MATER
           I've been trying to tell you that
           the whole time. I really am just a
           tow truck.
                         
          Finn and Holley take this in.
                         
                          HOLLEY
           Finn, he's not joking.
                         
                          FINN
           I know.
                         
                          MATER
           You were right, Finn. I'm a fool.
           And what's happened to McQueen is
           `cause I'm such a big one. This is
           all my fault.
                         
          GREM and ACER arrive on a lift, roll into view on a catwalk.
                         
                          GREM
           Good, you're up!
                         
                          ACER
           And just in time!
                         
                          GREM
           Professor Z wanted you to have a
           front row seat for the death of
           Lightning McQueen.
                         
                          MATER
                          (HOPEFUL)
           He's still alive?
                         
          Acer whips a sheet away, revealing the WGP CAMERA, turns it
          toward the clock face.
                         
                          ACER
           Not for much longer.
                         
          He pushes the camera through an open small window, turns it
          toward the course. Mater DROPS down again ---
                         
          FINN and HOLLEY CLICK FORWARD.
                         
          EXT. LONDON - DAY
                         
          Big Bentley's big hand CLICKS ahead another minute. But we're
          a bit farther away from it than before.
                         
           SALLY (O.S.)
           We came as soon as you called.

          Sally, flanked by Red, Flo and Ramone, are in front of ----

                          MCQUEEN
           I called to talk to Mater. It never
           occurred to me that he wouldn't be
           there.
                         
                          RAMONE
           Sheriff is talking to Scotland Yard
           right now.
                         
                          FLO
           And Sarge is in touch with his
           friends in the British military.
                         
                          SALLY
           You just need to focus on the race.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           I know, but Sal, with everything
           going on I'm not sure I should---
                         
          A HORN O.S. Someone's entering the pit. Everyone parts,
          revealing MILES AXLEROD.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Sir Axlerod.
                         
                          MILES AXLEROD
           I'm sorry to interrupt.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           No, no, it's all right.
                         
                          MILES AXLEROD
           I just wanted to come down here and
           personally thank you. Because after
           Italy, I was finished. And then you
           gave me one last shot.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Listen, I ---
                         
                          MILES AXLEROD
           And I probably shouldn't be saying
           this at all but... I hope you win
           today. Show the world that they've
           been wrong about Allinol.
                         
          McQueen takes this in. He looks at Sally.
           105.
                         
                         
                          SALLY
           Mater would want you to race.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           All right. For Mater.

           PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP (OVER RADIO)
           What happened!?
                         
                          GREM

           talking to the Professor---
                         
          They're all talking at once and for a moment we cannot
          understand what is being said.

          to Mater. But they SPIN IN PLACE, empty.
                         
          Grem and Acer just laugh more.

          Mater drives up the track. McQueen gains, fast. Because
          Mater's going backwards, they're face-to-face (but still with
          some distance between them).

           I don't know who that truck is,

          REVEAL ZUNDAPP is watching this footage from his luxury box.
          The closer McQueen gets to Mater the farther his tire ROLLS
          onto the detonator. But he holds back ever so slightly so as
          not to jump the gun.

           McQueen, you don't get it. I'm the

                          MCQUEEN
           Yes, Mater! You are the bomb!
           That's what I'm trying to say here.
           You've always been the bomb! And

          "OUT OF RANGE."
                         
          Zundapp can't believe it. He FLIPS OUT.

           people aren't taking you seriously,
           then they need to change. Not you.
           I know that, because I was wrong
           before. Now you can do this. You're
           the bomb.

          Mater starts to steer them the direction he wants. He and
          McQueen are FLYING OVER LONDON.
                         
          EXT. BALCONY - BUCKINGHAM PALACE - DAY

          angles into view. The clock's at T-minus 1:53.

           What? Me? You've got to be crazy.

           I figured it out when I realized
           you all attached this ticking time
           bomb with Whitworth bolts. The same
           bolts that hold together that old
           British engine from the photograph.
           Holley! Show that picture.

           O-kay...
                         
          Holley projects the much discussed PHOTO OF THE ENGINE.
                         
                          MATER
           And then I remembered what they say
           about old British engines - "If
           there ain't no oil under `em, there
           ain't no oil in `em."
                         
                          MILES AXLEROD
           What is he talking about?
                         
                          MATER
           It was you leaking oil at the party
           in Japan. You just blamed it on me.
                         
                          MILES AXLEROD
           Electric cars don't use oil, you

           Then you're faking it. You didn't
           convert to no electric. We pop that
           hood we gonna see that engine from
           that picture right there.
                         
          Mater moves toward Miles Axlerod to pop his hood.
                         
                          MILES AXLEROD
           This lorry's crazy. He's going to
           kill us all!
                         
          Miles Axlerod BACKS UP to the edge of the stage.
           125.
                         
                         
                          MILES AXLEROD
           Stay away!
                         
                          HOLLEY
           But Sir Axlerod created the race,
           Mater. Why would he want to hurt
           anyone?
                         
                          MATER
           To make Allinol look bad so
           everybody'd go back to using oil. I
           mean, he said it himself with that
           disguised voice.
                         
                          MILES AXLEROD
           "Dee-sguised voice?" What are you
           talking about? You're nuts, you
           are!
                         
          The QUEEN'S GUARDS have had ENOUGH. As has the PRINCE.
                         
                          PRINCE WHEELIAM
           This is going nowhere fast. We
           really should go, Grandmother.
                         
                          QUEEN
           One moment. I'd like to see where
           this is going.
                         
                          FINN
           Mater, he created Allinol.
                         
                          MATER
           Yeah, but what if he found that
           huge oil field just as the world
           was trying to find something else?
                         
          Mater sticks his ticking bomb-nose into Miles Axlerod's
          grill.
                         
                          MATER
           What if he came up with Allinol
           just to make alternative fuel look
           bad?
                         
                          MILES AXLEROD
           "What if?" You're basing this on a
           "What if"?!
                         
                          GUARD
           Okay, that's it.
                         
          And the QUEEN'S GUARDS spirit the Queen and Prince Wheeliam
          out of there FAST ---
           126.
                         
                         
                          MILES AXLEROD
           Wait! Somebody save me! The lorry's
           crazy!
                         
          Now it's just Miles Axlerod, Mater, McQueen, Finn and Holley.
          Miles Axlerod's back tires slip on the edge of the podium as
          he is cornered by Mater.
                         
                          MILES AXLEROD
           Keep away, you idiot!
                         
          00:00:08...
                         
                          FINN
           Mater!
                         
                          HOLLEY
           Mater!
                         
          00:03...00:02...
                         
                          MILES AXLEROD
           Someone do something!
                         
          Everyone FLINCHES, DUCKS or DIVES FOR COVER except McQueen,
          Mater and Axlerod ---
                         
                          MILES AXLEROD
           You're insane, you are!
           Deactivate!!
                         
          The bomb FREEZES at 00:01.
                         
           THE BOMB'S COMPUTER VOICE
           Bomb deactivated. Have a nice day,
           Sir Axlerod.
                         
          General shock all around. Miles Axlerod realizes what he's
          done, looks terrified. Police surround him.
                         
          Mater FLINGS Miles Axlerod's hood open with his hook,
          revealing AN INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE, oil dripping from
          all sides. It MATCHES the photo.
                         
                          FINN
           The engine from the photo.
                         
                          HOLLEY
           It's a perfect match!
                         
                          MILES AXLEROD
           How did the tow truck figure it
           out?
           127.
                         
                         
                          MCQUEEN
                          (TO MATER)
           It's official. You're coming to all
           my races from now on.
                         
                          MATER
           Now you're talking!
                         
          Tire bump.
                         
          EXT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - DAY
                         
          A massive crowd packs the adjacent streets and parks.
                         
          INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - DAY
                         
          Mater does the requisite "silly faces" in an attempt to break
          the composure of a Buckingham Palace Guard. It isn't working.
          McQueen approaches.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Mater, let's go. You're on.
                         
          INT. QUEEN'S CHAMBER - BUCKINGHAM PALACE - DAY
                         
          The Queen sits in attention at the front of the Main
          Ballroom. As Mater and McQueen approach:
                         
                          LORD STEWARD
           Your Majesty. May I present for the
           investiture of honorary Knighthood
           of the British Realm. Tow Mater of
           Radiator Springs.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Go get `em, buddy.
                         
          McQueen joins his friends from Radiator Springs. Mater rolls
          forward. He bows, as if he's practiced it all day.
                         
                          QUEEN
           I hereby dub thee "Sir Tow Mater."
                         
          Applause from all around.
                         
                          MATER
                          (LOOKS UP)
           "Sir?" Shoot, you can just call me
           Mater, Your Majesty. I don't wanna
           hear none of this "Sir" business.
           By the way, have y'all met each
           other? Queen? McQueen. McQueen,
           Queen. McQueen? McMissile.

           McMissile, McQueen. Queen?
           McMissile.
                         
          He continues introducing everyone as we CUT TO ---
                         
          EXT. RADIATOR SPRINGS - DAY
                         
          The town sign now reads "WELCOME TO RADIATOR SPRINGS - HOME
          OF LIGHTNING MCQUEEN AND SIR TOW MATER."
                         
          EXT. FLO'S - DAY
                         
          Cars surround Mater and McQueen. The rest of the Radiator
          Springs gang is here too, watches. VAN and MINNY are front
          and center.
                         
                          MATER
           So there I was: rocket jets going
           full blast, McQueen hanging on for
           dear life when suddenly them two
           nasty lemons come out of nowhere,
           guns drawed. We was goners. But
           then out of nowhere, this beautiful
           spy car swoops in from the sky to
           save us!
                         
                          MINNY
           That's a very entertaining story,
           young man.
                         
                          VAN
           Oh, Minny, please. Come on, none of
           this happened. Rocket jets? Flying
           spy cars?
                         
                          HOLLEY
           No, you're quite right. It does
           sound a bit far-fetched.
                         
          The crowd turns, sees HOLLEY, wings out, swooping in. FINN is
          right below her, driving up the street.
                         
                          MATER
           Holley! Finn!
                         
                          HOLLEY
           Hello, Mater. It's so nice to see
           you again.
                         
                          MATER
           What're you doing here?
           129.
                         
                         
                          FINN
           Our satellites picked up an urgent
           communique.
                         
                          LUIGI
           So you got my e-mail.
                         
                          MATER
           Oh, man. Y'all is gonna have a
           great time. Everybody! This here's
           Finn McMissile. He's a secret
           agent.
                          (WHISPERS)
           Don't tell nobody. And this is
           Holley Shiftwell. She's ---
                         
                          HOLLEY
           I'm Mater's girlfriend. It's so
           nice to meet you all.
                         
          Everyone is shocked. Including Mater. Guido's jaw drops.
                         
                          LUIGI
                          (TO MATER)
           Guido believe you now.

           Whoa, honey. You got a nasty dent
           there.
                         
          Indeed, Holley still wears the dent from when she saved Mater
          from Grem and Acer.
                         
                          VAN
           (already crushing on her)
           Was that from when you swooped in
           and saved them in London?
                         
                          MINNY
           Van!
                         
                          VAN
           What? I'm just asking.
                         
                          FLO
                          (TO HOLLEY)
           Don't you worry, sweet pea. My baby
           Ramone can get that fixed up for
           you in no time.
                         
                          RAMONE
           Yeah, sure thing. No problemo. Just
           let me go get my tools.
           130.
                         
                         
                          HOLLEY
           Oh no no. I'm keeping that dent.
           It's way too valuable.
                         
          Mater takes this in.
                         
                          LIZZIE
           A "valuable" dent? Oh, she's as
           crazy as Mater.
                         
                          MACK
           Those two are perfect for each
           other.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           You know, there's one thing I still
           don't get. The bad guys hit me with
           the beam from the camera, right? So
           why didn't I, you know...
                         
                          MATER
           Explode in a fiery inferno?
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Yeah.
                         
                          FINN
           We couldn't figure that one out
           either.
                         
                          HOLLEY
           Our investigation proved that
           Allinol was actually gasoline. And
           Miles Axlerod engineered it so that
           when it got hit by the beam it
           would explode.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Wait a second. Fillmore, you said
           my fuel was safe.
                         
          McQueen turns to Fillmore. Everyone does.
                         
                          FILLMORE
           If you're implying that I switched
           out that rotgut excuse for

           The Radiator Springs Grand Prix is
           about to begin! All spectators
           clear the starting line!

           Yeah, we should do this every year.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           I just figured, we never found out
           who the world's fastest car is.
           Plus: no press, no trophy. Just
           racing - the way I like it.

           Francesco. I'd like you to meet ---
                         
                          FRANCESCO
           Signorina Sally. It is official:
           Lightning McQueen is the luckiest
           car in the world.
                         
                          SALLY
                          (SWOONING)
           Why, thank you ---
                         
                          FRANCESCO
           Which he will have to be to have a
           chance against Francesco today.
                         
          Francesco turns to leave. As he's moving away:

           See you at the finish line, Mc---
                         
          Francesco STOPS.
                         
                          FRANCESCO
           What is that?
                         
          McQueen has a new bumper sticker: "Ka-ciao, Francesco."
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           It's just something I had made up
           for the occasion.
                         
                          FRANCESCO
           Is good, McQueen. Very funny. It
           was funnier when I did it, but
           it's very funny. What are you going
           to do next? Are you going to take
           off your fenders? Try it. You'll
           like it.
                         
          Francesco leaves. We stay with McQueen and Sally.
                         
                          SALLY
           So he's not so good-looking.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Yeah. Nice try.
                         
                          SALLY
           I'm serious.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           That's why I love you, Sally.
           (as he leaves)
           Wish me luck.
                         
                          SALLY
           You don't need it!
                         
          He drives off. Flo approaches Sally.
                         
                          FLO
           Mmm-mmm. That Francesco is fine-
           looking.
                         
                          SALLY
           And those open wheels.
                         
                          FLO
           I'm gonna have to go get myself
           some coolant.

          The racers at the starting grid. ON THE TRAFFIC LIGHT in the
          center of town. It goes from RED to GREEN!
                         
          The RACERS SPEED OFF, tearing up main street and out of town,

          sweeping turn around Willy's Butte we CRANE UP to see MATER,
          FINN, HOLLEY, and the Radiator Springs gang watching.
          Everyone CHEERS.
                         
                          MATER
           Go McQueen!! Whoo-hoo!!!
                         
          Holley gets an alert.
                         
                          HOLLEY
           Finn, time to go. Siddeley's
           gassed, geared and ready to fly.
                         
          Finn starts to back up.
                         
                          MATER
           You're leaving already?
                         
                          FINN
           We've got another mission, Mater.
           Just stopped by here to "pick
           something up."
                         
          They both eye Mater, expectantly.
                         
                          MATER
           Something tells me you're not
           talking about souvenir bumper
           stickers.
                         
                          FINN
           Her Majesty asked for you
           personally, Mater.
                         
                          MATER
           But I told you all before. I'm not
           a spy.
                         
                          HOLLEY
           We know.
           134.
                         
                         
                          FINN
           Spy or not, you're still the
           smartest, most honest chap we've
           ever met.
                         
                          HOLLEY
           Don't forget massively charming.
                         
          Mater looks over at Holley. He looks touched.
                         
                          MATER
           Well, thanks. But as much fun as it
           was hanging with y'all, this...
                         
          He looks over to his friends who watch the race, CHEER
          MCQUEEN ON.
                         
                          MATER
           This is home.
                         
                          HOLLEY
           That's alright, we understand. But
           I'll be back. You still owe me that
           first date.
                         
                          FINN
           If there's ever anything I can do
           for you, just let me know.
                         
                          MATER
           Well, I sure appreciate that, thank
           you.
                          (THINKS)
           Actually... there is one thing.
                          CUT TO:
                         
          EXT. RADIATOR SPRINGS - MOMENTS LATER
                         
          MATER, blazing forward fast.
                         
                          MATER
           Whoo-hoo!!!
                         
          He ROCKETS FORWARD, through the whole town. In doing so he
          GRABS A BROKEN DOWN OTIS, hooking him ---
                         
                          OTIS
           Whoa!!!
                         
          --- and TOSSING him right into Ramone's.
                         
           OTIS (O.S.)
           Thanks, Mater!
           135.
                         
                         
          ON THE "RACE TRACK" - Mater flies past ALL the racers,
          including Francesco ---
                         
                          FRANCESCO
           Impossible!
                         
          --- until he approaches MCQUEEN.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Mater!?
                         
                          MATER
                          (KEEPING PACE)
           Check it out. They let me keep the
           rockets!
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           I'll see you at the finish line,
           buddy!
                         
                          MATER
           Not if I see you first!
                         
          McQueen and Mater peel away from the rest of the racers, lead
          them off the road and into the dirt for another lap. The two
          friends are side by side when we FADE OUT.

/**
 * @dev Implementation of the {IERC20} interface.
 *
 * This implementation is agnostic to the way tokens are created. This means
 * that a supply mechanism has to be added in a derived contract using {_mint}.
 * For a generic mechanism see {ERC20PresetMinterPauser}.
 *
 * TIP: For a detailed writeup see our guide
 * https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/how-to-implement-erc20-supply-mechanisms/226[How
 * to implement supply mechanisms].
 *
 * We have followed general OpenZeppelin Contracts guidelines: functions revert
 * instead returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless
 * conventional and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20
 * applications.
 *
 * Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}.
 * This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just
 * by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit
 * these events, as it isn't required by the specification.
 *
 * Finally, the non-standard {decreaseAllowance} and {increaseAllowance}
 * functions have been added to mitigate the well-known issues around setting
 * allowances. See {IERC20-approve}.
