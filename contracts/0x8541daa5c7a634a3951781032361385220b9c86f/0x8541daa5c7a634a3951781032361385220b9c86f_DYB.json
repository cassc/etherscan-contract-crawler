He was an eccentric character,       //\\n//    whether or not he was a rich one, the old yet ageless friend of every nite-watch       //\\n//    copper-on-the-beat and late shift taxi driver - to mention but a few common or         //\\n//    garden nite-hawks - to the east, west, north and south of anywhere you care to         //\\n//    name. If two men at opposite sides of the world met and found they had the nite        //\\n//    in common then they would doubtless in the course of conversation find that they       //\\n//    also shared a friend in Dr. Yellow-boots. When not talking he stared out from          //\\n//    under a battered old hat, the tip of which brushed his dusty white eyebrows            //\\n//    which in turn brushed his ill fitting spectacles. His eyes were never still.           //\\n//    His skin was wrinkled yet they were more the wrinkles of a baby\u2019s excess fat than      //\\n//    those of age; skin wrapped around him like a blanket, too large but comfortable.       //\\n//    He wore an aged grey overcoat which, he insisted, had been made for him by the         //\\n//    personal tailor to the Prince of \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 in the days when the Empire flourished,         //\\n//    and a pair of tan ankle-hugging boots from which his strange, yet entirely             //\\n//    suitable name had arisen. To have called him a tramp would have been an insult,        //\\n//    if he was a doctor of nothing more than \u2018wordeology\u2019 as one man put it he was          //\\n//    indeed deserving of a title of some sorts. Further-more, search as one might,          //\\n//    Dr. Yellow-boots had never been seen in the light of day. To some the situation        //\\n//    was ominous: some said he was a vampire: some said he was a ghost.                     //\\n//    But to most, Dr. Yellow-boots merely \u2018was\u2019. Everyone accepted him and the scene        //\\n//    would have been quite incomplete without him. Sometimes he would vanish for            //\\n//    weeks on end, no-one knew to where, but always Dr. Yellow-boots was and always         //\\n//    had been. It never occurred to anyone that one dawn he would disappear and             //\\n//    never return. Only Dr. Yellow-boots himself knew that he was not and never had         //\\n//    been eternal - he had just been around the nite for longer than most.                  //\\n//    Even the cruelly down to earth copper would not accept him as a tramp.                 //\\n//    They said he had enough money stashed away to buy the police force if he set his       //\\n//    mind to it and at times no doubt wished he would. Even the most acute minded           //\\n//    detective constable would not risk his reputation on a hazarded guess as to            //\\n//    where the Dr. Went when the first rays of dawn marauded the nite and the man           //\\n//    himself had a different answer each time the question was posed. Summer painted        //\\n//    the doctors face deep brown, to match his eyes; eyes that twinkled whatever the        //\\n//    weather thro the dusty lenses of the before-mentioned ill-fitting spectacles.          //\\n//    In the summer his face appear to be moulded out of clay and in the winter              //\\n//    chiselled out of granite. Apart from that Dr. Yellow-boots was reasonless:             //\\n//    he never changed his clothes or his expression of mil surprise; never altered          //\\n//    the tone of his voice or the pace at which he silently circumnavigated the             //\\n//    buildings untidy men had dropped in his path, for it seemed that Dr. Yellow-boots      //\\n//    route had been plotted first.                                                          //\\n//                                                                                           //\\n//    Folk had long since ceased to wonder if the human race had bestowed upon Dr.           //\\n//    Yellow-boots a name more common to mankind at large. To discover that he had           //\\n//    been christened Fred would, to say the least, have more than somewhat killed the       //\\n//    image which was, as a matter of fact, macabre. A man of definite regal bearing         //\\n//    he was neither tramp nor confidence trickster merely, or so was the common             //\\n//    opinion, a man of the world no longer satisfied with the day. The nite, he had once    //\\n//    e remarked to a fascinated taxi-driver, had no shadows; altho precisely what that      //\\n//    had meant in relation to himself no-one was clever enough to deduce and they           //\\n//    could not have shown ignorance enough to question a statement that was so              //\\n//    obviously true.                                                                        //\\n//                                                                                           //\\n//    Dr. Yellow-boots had, in his time, done many strange & wonderful things; so many       //\\n//    in fact that his age was a matter for the most serious debate; but the truth or        //\\n//    otherwise of his stories was of little consequence: they lived, whether or not         //\\n//    anyone or thing other than the Dr\u2019s imagination had given them birth was not, as       //\\n//    has been remarked upon, of any significance.                                           //\\n//                                                                                           //\\n//    Dr. Yellow-boots walked with his hands tucked firmly in the pockets of his             //\\n//    bespoke overcoat.
