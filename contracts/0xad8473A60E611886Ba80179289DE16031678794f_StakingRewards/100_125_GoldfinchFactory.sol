   * @param _interestApr The interest amount, on an annualized basis (APR, so non-compounding), expressed as an integer.
   *  We assume 18 digits of precision. For example, to submit 15.34%, you would pass up 153400000000000000,
   *  and 5.34% would be 53400000000000000
   * @param _paymentPeriodInDays How many days in each payment period.
   *  ie. the frequency with which they need to make payments.
   * @param _termInDays Number of days in the credit term. It is used to set the `termEndTime` upon first drawdown.
   *  ie. The credit line should be fully paid off {_termIndays} days after the first drawdown.
   * @param _lateFeeApr The additional interest you will pay if you are late. For example, if this is 3%, and your
   *  normal rate is 15%, then you will pay 18% while you are late. Also expressed as an 18 decimal precision integer
