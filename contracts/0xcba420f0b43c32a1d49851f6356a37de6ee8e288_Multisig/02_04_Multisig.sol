Multisig Contract
  This is a general-purpose multisig wallet contract where each token of the Terminally Online series gives its owner a single vote on wallet actions.
  The contract logic is based on the Open Zeppelin Governor contract.

  While this contract has the ability to receive any asset, it has two primary roles:
    1. To manage the TokenURI contract of the Terminally Online project. The initial TokenURI contract allows the multisig to update the project's base externalUrl.
    2. To manage the terminallyonline.eth ENS domain, and all subdomain (which it has been given ownership of).

  Proposals
    For the multisig execute any transaction, Terminally Online token holders must take the following steps:
      1. Someone must propose a transaction using `propose`. This must include the tokenId of the proposer, the target address of the transaction, the amount of ETH included in the transaction, and the calldata of the transaction.
      2. A simple majority of the Terminally Online token holders must vote for the proposal.
      3. Once enough votes have been secured, someone must execute the proposal.

  Admin Execution
    For the sake of expediency, the multisig contract can designate an address as the admin, which has the unilateral ability to execute multisig transactions without any votes.
    While the admin can be an EOA, this contract can also be extended by designating another contract as the admin. For example, another contract can define logic in which token holder signatures are validated, which would allow for more gas-efficient voting.
    To set the admin, a proposal needs to be made in which the multisig calls setAdmin on itself.
