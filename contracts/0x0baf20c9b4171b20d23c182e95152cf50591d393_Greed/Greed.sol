I sniped LSVR and was the third buyer and it started mooning, 
Volume was crazy but that got me scared , It could dump with same pace as it pumped. 
I couldn’t decide what to do: To hold or to sell, I was up 20x but wanted more, 
Who doesn’t love money, but at same time i was scared as it could dump and most of my profit would be gone , 
I let my greed win and holded, but there was a voice asking me if what i was doing was right? 
It was the only time when bring greedy ended up benefiting me and made me more money. 
LSVR skyrocketed and i made way more than i expected.

My intention with Greed coin is simple, if everyone holds the floor it’s obvious we will moon some time or another and if everyone penny sells it’s obvious it’ll be an hour play. 
So it is upto you all if you’ll let the greed within win.

No one can satisfy Greed, It’s the essence of having more. 
Sometimes I think to myself, Elon Musk is worth over 100 Billion dollars and he still wants more. 
What is the point of wanting more money when you have 100 billion dollars, you will never be able to spend it even 10 billion is an amount with you, your grandchildren and their children would not be able to spend in one life time. 
But he does not stop, he wants more. That is the essence of human nature, filled with greed and the more you have the more you want. It becomes like an obsession, like a mania.

Yes we all want more and wanting more and earning more gives me motivation, 
however I hope that if i ever have 100 billion dollars that my greed will be quenched and that I will not become delusional and keep obsessing over money, unlike some people.
