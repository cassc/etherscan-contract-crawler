The sender does not need to be aware\\n * that the Ether will be split in this way, since it is handled transparently by the contract.\\n *\\n * The split can be in equal parts or in any other arbitrary proportion. The way this is specified is by assigning each\\n * account to a number of shares. Of all the Ether that this contract receives, each account will then be able to claim\\n * an amount proportional to the percentage of total shares they were assigned. The distribution of shares is set at the\\n * time of contract deployment and can't be updated thereafter.\\n *\\n * `PaymentSplitter` follows a _pull payment_ model. This means that payments are not automatically forwarded to the\\n * accounts but kept in this contract, and the actual transfer is triggered as a separate step by calling the {release}\\n * function.\\n *\\n * NOTE: This contract assumes that ERC20 tokens will behave similarly to native tokens (Ether). Rebasing tokens, and\\n * tokens that apply fees during transfers, are likely to not be supported as expected. If in doubt, we encourage you\\n * to run tests before sending real value to this contract.\\n */\\ncontract PaymentSplitterUpgradeable is Initializable, ContextUpgradeable {\\n    event PayeeAdded(address account, uint256 shares);\\n    event PaymentReleased(address to, uint256 amount);\\n    event ERC20PaymentReleased(IERC20Upgradeable indexed token, address to, uint256 amount);\\n    event PaymentReceived(address from, uint256 amount);\\n\\n    uint256 private _totalShares;\\n    uint256 private _totalReleased;\\n\\n    mapping(address => uint256) private _shares;\\n    mapping(address => uint256) private _released;\\n    address[] private _payees;\\n\\n    mapping(IERC20Upgradeable => uint256) private _erc20TotalReleased;\\n    mapping(IERC20Upgradeable => mapping(address => uint256)) private _erc20Released;\\n\\n    /**\\n     * @dev Creates an instance of `PaymentSplitter` where each account in `payees` is assigned the number of shares at\\n     * the matching position in the `shares` array.\\n     *\\n     * All addresses in `payees` must be non-zero.

or any kind of contract that will be deployed\\n * behind a proxy. Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an\\n * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer\\n * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.\\n *\\n * The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be\\n * reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each \\\"step\\\" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in\\n * case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.\\n *\\n * For example:\\n *\\n * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]\\n * ```\\n * contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {\\n *     function initialize() initializer public {\\n *         __ERC20_init(\\\"MyToken\\\", \\\"MTK\\\");\\n *     }\\n * }\\n * contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {\\n *     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {\\n *         __ERC20Permit_init(\\\"MyToken\\\");\\n *     }\\n * }\\n * ```\\n *\\n * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as\\n * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.\\n *\\n * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure\\n * that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.\\n *\\n * [CAUTION]\\n * ====\\n * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.\\n *\\n * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation\\n * contract, which may impact the proxy.
