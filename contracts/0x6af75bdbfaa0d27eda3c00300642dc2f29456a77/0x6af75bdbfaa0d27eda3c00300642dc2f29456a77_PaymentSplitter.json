The way this is specified is by assigning each\r\n * account to a number of shares. Of all the Ether that this contract receives, each account will then be able to claim\r\n * an amount proportional to the percentage of total shares they were assigned.\r\n *\r\n * `PaymentSplitter` follows a _pull payment_ model. This means that payments are not automatically forwarded to the\r\n * accounts but kept in this contract, and the actual transfer is triggered as a separate step by calling the {release}\r\n * function.\r\n *\r\n * NOTE: This contract assumes that ERC20 tokens will behave similarly to native tokens (Ether). Rebasing tokens, and\r\n * tokens that apply fees during transfers, are likely to not be supported as expected.
