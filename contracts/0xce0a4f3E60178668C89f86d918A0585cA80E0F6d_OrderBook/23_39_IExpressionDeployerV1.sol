/// @title IExpressionDeployerV1
/// @notice Companion to `IInterpreterV1` responsible for onchain static code
/// analysis and deploying expressions. Each `IExpressionDeployerV1` is tightly
/// coupled at the bytecode level to some interpreter that it knows how to
/// analyse and deploy expressions for. The expression deployer can perform an
/// integrity check "dry run" of candidate source code for the intepreter. The
/// critical analysis/transformation includes:
///
/// - Enforcement of no out of bounds memory reads/writes
/// - Calculation of memory required to eval the stack with a single allocation
/// - Replacing index based opcodes with absolute interpreter function pointers
/// - Enforcement that all opcodes and operands used exist and are valid
///
/// This analysis is highly sensitive to the specific implementation and position
/// of all opcodes and function pointers as compiled into the interpreter. This
/// is what makes the coupling between an interpreter and expression deployer
/// so tight. Ideally all responsibilities would be handled by a single contract
/// but this introduces code size issues quickly by roughly doubling the compiled
/// logic of each opcode (half for the integrity check and half for evaluation).
///
/// Interpreters MUST assume that expression deployers are malicious and fail
/// gracefully if the integrity check is corrupt/bypassed and/or function
/// pointers are incorrect, etc. i.e. the interpreter MUST always return a stack
/// from `eval` in a read only way or error. I.e. it is the expression deployer's
/// responsibility to do everything it can to prevent undefined behaviour in the
/// interpreter, and the interpreter's responsibility to handle the expression
/// deployer completely failing to do so.

    /// formats like json that make heavy use of boilerplate, repetition and
    /// whitespace, some kind of compression is recommended.

    /// eval some expression and define all its opcodes are available as
    /// libraries.
    ///
    /// In practise there are enough advantages to deploying the sources directly
    /// onchain as contract data and loading them from the interpreter at eval:
    ///
    /// - Loading and storing binary data is gas efficient as immutable contract
    ///   data
    /// - Expressions need to be immutable between their deploy time integrity
    ///   check and runtime evaluation
    /// - Passing the address of an expression through calldata to an interpreter
    ///   is cheaper than passing an entire expression through calldata
    /// - Conceptually a very simple approach, even if implementations like
    ///   SSTORE2 are subtle under the hood
    ///
    /// The expression deployer MUST perform an integrity check of the source
    /// code before it puts the expression onchain at a known address. The
    /// integrity check MUST at a minimum (it is free to do additional static
    /// analysis) calculate the memory required to be allocated for the stack in
    /// total, and that no out of bounds memory reads/writes occur within this
    /// stack. A simple example of an invalid source would be one that pushes one
    /// value to the stack then attempts to pops two values, clearly we cannot
    /// remove more values than we added. The `IExpressionDeployerV1` MUST revert
    /// in the case of any integrity failure, all integrity checks MUST pass in
    /// order for the deployment to complete.
    ///
    /// Once the integrity check is complete the `IExpressionDeployerV1` MUST do
    /// any additional processing required by its paired interpreter.
    /// For example, the `IExpressionDeployerV1` MAY NEED to replace the indexed
    /// opcodes in the `ExpressionConfig` sources with real function pointers
    /// from the corresponding interpreter.
    ///
    /// @param sources Sources verbatim. These sources MUST be provided in their
    /// sequential/index opcode form as the deployment process will need to index
    /// into BOTH the integrity check and the final runtime function pointers.
    /// This will be emitted in an event for offchain processing to use the
    /// indexed opcode sources. The first N sources are considered entrypoints
    /// and will be integrity checked by the expression deployer against a
    /// starting stack height of 0. Non-entrypoint sources MAY be provided for
    /// internal use such as the `call` opcode but will NOT be integrity checked
    /// UNLESS entered by an opcode in an entrypoint.
    /// @param constants Constants verbatim. Constants are provided alongside
    /// sources rather than inline as it allows us to avoid variable length
    /// opcodes and can be more memory efficient if the same constant is
    /// referenced several times from the sources.
    /// @param minOutputs The first N sources on the state config are entrypoints
    /// to the expression where N is the length of the `minOutputs` array. Each
    /// item in the `minOutputs` array specifies the number of outputs that MUST
    /// be present on the final stack for an evaluation of each entrypoint. The
    /// minimum output for some entrypoint MAY be zero if the expectation is that
    /// the expression only applies checks and error logic. Non-entrypoint
    /// sources MUST NOT have a minimum outputs length specified.
