/// @title FixedPointMath
/// @notice Sometimes we want to do math with decimal values but all we have
/// are integers, typically uint256 integers. Floats are very complex so we
/// don't attempt to simulate them. Instead we provide a standard definition of
/// "one" as 10 ** 18 and scale everything up/down to this as fixed point math.
///
/// Overflows SATURATE rather than error, e.g. scaling max uint256 up will result
/// in max uint256. The max uint256 as decimal is roughly 1e77 so scaling values
/// comparable to 1e18 is unlikely to ever saturate in practise. For a typical
/// use case involving tokens, the entire supply of a token rescaled up a full
/// 18 decimals would still put it "only" in the region of ~1e40 which has a full
/// 30 orders of magnitude buffer before running into saturation issues. However,
/// there's no theoretical reason that a token or any other use case couldn't use
/// large numbers or extremely precise decimals that would push this library to
/// saturation point, so it MUST be treated with caution around the edge cases.
///
/// One case where values could come near the saturation/overflow point is phantom
/// overflow. This is where an overflow happens during the internal logic of some
/// operation like "fixed point multiplication" even though the final result fits
/// within uint256. The fixed point multiplication and division functions are
/// thin wrappers around Open Zeppelin's `mulDiv` function, that handles phantom
/// overflow, reducing the problems of rescaling overflow/saturation to the input
/// and output range rather than to the internal implementation details. For this
/// library that gives an additional full 18 orders of magnitude for safe fixed
/// point multiplication operations.
///
/// Scaling down ANY fixed point decimal also reduces the precision which can
/// lead to  dust or in the worst case trapped funds if subsequent subtraction
/// overflows a rounded-down number. Consider using saturating subtraction for
/// safety against previously downscaled values, and whether trapped dust is a
/// significant issue. If you need to retain full/arbitrary precision in the case
/// of downscaling DO NOT use this library.
///
/// All rescaling and/or division operations in this library require the rounding
/// flag from Open Zeppelin math. This allows and forces the caller to specify
/// where dust sits due to rounding. For example the caller could round up when
/// taking tokens from `msg.sender` and round down when returning them, ensuring
/// that any dust in the round trip accumulates in the contract rather than
/// opening an exploit or reverting and trapping all funds. This is exactly how
/// the ERC4626 vault spec handles dust and is a good reference point in general.
/// Typically the contract holding tokens and non-interactive participants should
/// be favoured by rounding calculations rather than active participants. This is
/// because we assume that an active participant, e.g. `msg.sender`, knowns
/// something we don't and is carefully crafting an attack, so we are most
/// conservative and suspicious of their inputs and actions.
