/**
 * @title Ownable contract module.
 * @author Ing. Michael Goldfinger
 * @notice Contract module which provides a basic access control mechanism, where
 * there is an address (an owner) that can be granted exclusive access to specific functions.
 * By default, the owner account will be the one that deploys the contract. This
 * can later be changed with the function {transferOwnership(address newOwner)}".
 * @dev This module is used through inheritance. It will make available the modifier
 * {onlyOwner}, which can be applied to your functions to restrict their use to the owner.
