- Team Allocation : 10% of the total supply was allocated to the core team and advisors to align their 
interests with the long-term success of the project. These tokens are typically vested over a defined period.
- Ecosystem/Treasury: 33% of the total supply was reserved for ecosystem development, strategic 
partnerships, and marketing efforts to foster adoption and growth.
- Liquidity Pool: 25% of the total supply was dedicated to seeding liquidity pools to facilitate trading 
on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and provide liquidity for TAFABOT holders.

rewards for early adopters, staking programs, and governance participation.*/
