 * @dev This is a base contract to aid in writing upgradeable contracts, or any kind of contract that will be deployed

 * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.
 *
 * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as
 * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.
 *
 * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure
 * that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.
 *
 * [CAUTION]
 * ====
 * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.
 *
 * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation
 * contract, which may impact the proxy. To initialize the implementation contract, you can either invoke the
 * initializer manually, or you can include a constructor to automatically mark it as initialized when it is deployed:

 * TIP: For a detailed writeup see our guide

 * We have followed general OpenZeppelin Contracts guidelines: functions revert
 * instead returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless
 * conventional and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20
 * applications.
 *
 * Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}.
 * This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just
 * by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit
 * these events, as it isn't required by the specification.
 *
 * Finally, the non-standard {decreaseAllowance} and {increaseAllowance}
 * functions have been added to mitigate the well-known issues around setting
 * allowances. See {IERC20-approve}.

 * @dev This contract is fully forked from OpenZeppelin `AccessControlUpgradeable`.
 * The only difference is the removal of the ERC165 implementation as it's not
 * needed in Angle.
 *
 * Contract module that allows children to implement role-based access
 * control mechanisms. This is a lightweight version that doesn't allow enumerating role
 * members except through off-chain means by accessing the contract event logs. Some
 * applications may benefit from on-chain enumerability, for those cases see
 * {AccessControlEnumerable}.
 *
 * Roles are referred to by their `bytes32` identifier. These should be exposed
 * in the external API and be unique. The best way to achieve this is by
 * using `public constant` hash digests:
 *
 * ```
 * bytes32 public constant MY_ROLE = keccak256("MY_ROLE");
 * ```
 *
 * Roles can be used to represent a set of permissions. To restrict access to a
 * function call, use {hasRole}:
 *
 * ```
 * function foo() public {
 *     require(hasRole(MY_ROLE, msg.sender));
 *     ...
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Roles can be granted and revoked dynamically via the {grantRole} and
 * {revokeRole} functions. Each role has an associated admin role, and only
 * accounts that have a role's admin role can call {grantRole} and {revokeRole}.
 *
 * By default, the admin role for all roles is `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, which means
 * that only accounts with this role will be able to grant or revoke other
 * roles. More complex role relationships can be created by using
 * {_setRoleAdmin}.
 *
 * WARNING: The `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` is also its own admin: it has permission to
 * grant and revoke this role. Extra precautions should be taken to secure
 * accounts that have been granted it.

	// `IERC20.transferFrom`. In these cases, the sender must have previously allowed the Vault to use their tokens by
	// calling `IERC20.approve`. The only deviation from the ERC20 standard that is supported is functions not returning
	// a boolean value: in these scenarios, a non-reverting call is assumed to be successful.
	//
	// - All non-view functions in the Vault are non-reentrant: calling them while another one is mid-execution (e.g.
	// while execution control is transferred to a token contract during a swap) will result in a revert. View
	// functions can be called in a re-reentrant way, but doing so might cause them to return inconsistent results.

	//
	// There are two swap kinds:
	//  - 'given in' swaps, where the amount of tokens in (sent to the Pool) is known, and the Pool determines (via the
	// `onSwap` hook) the amount of tokens out (to send to the recipient).
	//  - 'given out' swaps, where the amount of tokens out (received from the Pool) is known, and the Pool determines
	// (via the `onSwap` hook) the amount of tokens in (to receive from the sender).
	//
	// Additionally, it is possible to chain swaps using a placeholder input amount, which the Vault replaces with
	// the calculated output of the previous swap. If the previous swap was 'given in', this will be the calculated
	// tokenOut amount. If the previous swap was 'given out', it will use the calculated tokenIn amount. These extended
	// swaps are known as 'multihop' swaps, since they 'hop' through a number of intermediate tokens before arriving at
	// the final intended token.
	//
	// In all cases, tokens are only transferred in and out of the Vault (or withdrawn from and deposited into Internal
	// Balance) after all individual swaps have been completed, and the net token balance change computed. This makes
	// certain swap patterns, such as multihops, or swaps that interact with the same token pair in multiple Pools, cost
	// much less gas than they would otherwise.
	//
	// It also means that under certain conditions it is possible to perform arbitrage by swapping with multiple
	// Pools in a way that results in net token movement out of the Vault (profit), with no tokens being sent in (only
	// updating the Pool's internal accounting).
	//
	// To protect users from front-running or the market changing rapidly, they supply a list of 'limits' for each token
	// involved in the swap, where either the maximum number of tokens to send (by passing a positive value) or the
	// minimum amount of tokens to receive (by passing a negative value) is specified.
	//
	// Additionally, a 'deadline' timestamp can also be provided, forcing the swap to fail if it occurs after
	// this point in time (e.g. if the transaction failed to be included in a block promptly).
	//
	// If interacting with Pools that hold WETH, it is possible to both send and receive ETH directly: the Vault will do
	// the wrapping and unwrapping. To enable this mechanism, the IAsset sentinel value (the zero address) must be
	// passed in the `assets` array instead of the WETH address. Note that it is possible to combine ETH and WETH in the
	// same swap. Any excess ETH will be sent back to the caller (not the sender, which is relevant for relayers).
	//
	// Finally, Internal Balance can be used when either sending or receiving tokens.
