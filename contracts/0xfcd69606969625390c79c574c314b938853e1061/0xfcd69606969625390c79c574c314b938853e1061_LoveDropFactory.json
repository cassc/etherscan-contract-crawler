behind a proxy. Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an\\n * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer\\n * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.\\n *\\n * The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be\\n * reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each \\\"step\\\" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in\\n * case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.\\n *\\n * For example:\\n *\\n * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]\\n * ```solidity\\n * contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {\\n *     function initialize() initializer public {\\n *         __ERC20_init(\\\"MyToken\\\", \\\"MTK\\\");\\n *     }\\n * }\\n *\\n * contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {\\n *     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {\\n *         __ERC20Permit_init(\\\"MyToken\\\");\\n *     }\\n * }\\n * ```\\n *\\n * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as\\n * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.\\n *\\n * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure\\n * that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.\\n *\\n * [CAUTION]\\n * ====\\n * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.\\n *\\n * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation\\n * contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke\\n * the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:\\n *\\n * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]\\n * ```\\n * /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor\\n * constructor() {\\n *     _disableInitializers();\\n * }\\n * ```\\n * ====\\n */\\nabstract contract Initializable {\\n    /**\\n     * @dev Indicates that the contract has been initialized.\\n     * @custom:oz-retyped-from bool\\n     */\\n    uint8 private _initialized;\\n\\n    /**\\n     * @dev Indicates that the contract is in the process of being initialized.\\n     */\\n    bool private _initializing;\\n\\n    /**\\n     * @dev Triggered when the contract has been initialized or reinitialized.\\n     */\\n    event Initialized(uint8 version);\\n\\n    /**\\n     * @dev A modifier that defines a protected initializer function that can be invoked at most once.
