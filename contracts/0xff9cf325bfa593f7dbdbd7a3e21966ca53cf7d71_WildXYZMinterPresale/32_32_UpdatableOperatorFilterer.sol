/**
 * @title  UpdatableOperatorFilterer
 * @notice Abstract contract whose constructor automatically registers and optionally subscribes to or copies another
 *         registrant's entries in the OperatorFilterRegistry. This contract allows the Owner to update the
 *         OperatorFilterRegistry address via updateOperatorFilterRegistryAddress, including to the zero address,
 *         which will bypass registry checks.
 *         Note that OpenSea will still disable creator earnings enforcement if filtered operators begin fulfilling orders
 *         on-chain, eg, if the registry is revoked or bypassed.
 * @dev    This smart contract is meant to be inherited by token contracts so they can use the following:
 *         - `onlyAllowedOperator` modifier for `transferFrom` and `safeTransferFrom` methods.
 *         - `onlyAllowedOperatorApproval` modifier for `approve` and `setApprovalForAll` methods.
