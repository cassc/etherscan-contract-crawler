 *
 * ATTENTION!
 * 
 * This code? IS NOT DESIGNED FOR ACTUAL USE.
 * 
 * The author of this code really wishes you wouldn't send your ETH to it, but it's been
 * done with P3D and there are very happy users because of it.
 * 
 * No, seriously. It's probablly illegal anyway. So don't do it.
 * 
 * Let me repeat that: Don't actually send money to this contract. You are 
 * likely breaking several local and national laws in doing so.
 * 
 * This code is intended to educate. Nothing else. If you use it, expect S.W.A.T 
 * teams at your door. I wrote this code because I wanted to experiment
 * with smart contracts, and I think code should be open source. So consider
 * it public domain, No Rights Reserved. Participating in pyramid schemes
 * is genuinely illegal so just don't even think about going beyond
 * reading the code and understanding how it works.
 * 
 * Seriously. I'm not kidding. It's probablly broken in some critical way anyway
 * and will suck all your money out your wallet, install a virus on your computer
 * sleep with your wife, kidnap your children and sell them into slavery,
 * make you forget to file your taxes, and give you cancer.
 * 
 * 
 * What it does:
 * 
 * It takes 50% of the ETH in it and buys tokens.
 * It takes 50% of the ETH in it and pays back depositors.
 * Depositors get in line and are paid out in order of deposit, plus the deposit
 * percent.
 * The tokens collect dividends, which in turn pay into the payout pool
 * to be split 50/50.
 * 
 * If you're seeing this contract in it's initial configuration, it should be
 * set to 200% (double deposits), and pointed at PoWH:
 * 0xB3775fB83F7D12A36E0475aBdD1FCA35c091efBe
 * 
 * But you should verify this for yourself.
