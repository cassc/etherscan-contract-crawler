/**
    Adapted from openzeppelin's UUPSUpgradeable

    However, with some notable differences
        
        We don't use the whole "initializers" scheme.  It's error-prone and awkward.  A couple contracts
        may have an initialize function, but it's not some special built-in scheme that can be screwed up.

        We don't use beacons, and we don't need to upgrade from old UUPS or other types of proxies.  We
        only support UUPS.  We don't support rollbacks.

        We don't use default-slot storage.  It's also error-prone and awkward.  It's weird that it was ever
        done that way in the first place.  But regardless, we don't.

        We have no concept of "Admin" at this stage.  Whoever implements "beforeUpgrade" can decide to
        check access if they want to.  For us, we do this in "UpgradeableBase".
