Hey, I am launching this coin in order to break any and all limits. 
I want this name to represent something which is unstoppable which never stops growing. 
Thus this coin should have no limits and always keep going higher and keep going to infinity and beyond. 
This will be a 0 tax point as my goal is to push it higher and higher and break all limits. 
I will be a holder just like the rest of you, 
I will have no advantages over any of you and thus the playground will be fair.

Infinity is that which is boundless, endless, or larger than any natural number. 
It is always possible to think of a larger number: for the number of times a magnitude 
can be bisected is infinite. Hence the infinite is potential.

Infinity is a concept that can not be real grasped as we are finite beings, 
living finite lives in a finite universe. So how can one who has no ability 
to relate to the concept somehow manage to understand it. 
It is something that never ends that can go on forever with unlimited potential.
 
So we will all be in the same boat and equally responsible to push this to heights which have never been seen before.
