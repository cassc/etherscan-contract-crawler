                we want to avoid the interests calculus to overflow so the result must not exceed 1e77
                as (1e77 < type(uint256).max). So we can allow `lent` to go as high as 1e40, but not above.
                This explains why borrowing throws on loan.lent > 1e40, as this realisticly avoids
                repaying being impossible due to an overflow. */
