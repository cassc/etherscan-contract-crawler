/// "operator" that is the one used by a backend app to make some calls
/// @dev It saves in an ordered array the player wallet and the current
/// entries count. So buying entries has a complexity of O(1)
/// For calculating the winner, from the huge random number generated by Chainlink
/// a normalized random is generated by using the module method, adding 1 to have
/// a random from 1 to entriesCount.
/// So next step is to perform a binary search on the ordered array to get the
/// player O(log n)
/// Example:
/// 0 -> { 1, player1} as player1 buys 1 entry
/// 1 -> {51, player2} as player2 buys 50 entries
/// 2 -> {52, player3} as player3 buys 1 entry
/// 3 -> {53, player4} as player4 buys 1 entry
/// 4 -> {153, player5} as player5 buys 100 entries
/// So the setWinner method performs a binary search on that sorted array to get the upper bound.
/// If the random number generated is 150, the winner is player5. If the random number is 20, winner is player2
