heaven, and earth.\r\n2 And the earth was void and empty, and\r\ndarkness was upon the face of the deep; and the\r\nspirit of God moved over the waters.\r\n3 And God said: Be light made. And light\r\nwas made.\r\n4 And God saw the light that it was good; and\r\nhe divided the light from the darkness.\r\n5 And he called the light Day, and the darkness Night; and there was evening and morning\r\none day.\r\n6 And God said: Let there be a firmament\r\nmade amidst the waters: and let it divide the\r\nwaters from the waters.\r\n7 And god made a firmament, and divided\r\nthe waters that were under the firmament, from\r\nthose that were above the firmament, and it was\r\nso.\r\n8 And God called the firmament, Heaven; and\r\nthe evening and morning were the second day.\r\n9 God also said; Let the waters that are under\r\nthe heaven, be gathered together into one place:\r\nand let the dry land appear. And it was so done.\r\n10 And God called the dry land, Earth; and\r\nthe gathering together of the waters, he called\r\nSeas. And God saw that it was good.\r\n11 And he said: let the earth bring forth green\r\nherb, and such as may seed, and the fruit tree\r\nyielding fruit after its kind, which may have seed\r\nin itself upon the earth. And it was so done.\r\n12 And the earth brought forth the green\r\nherb, and such as yieldeth seed according to its\r\nkind, and the tree that beareth fruit, having seed\r\neach one according to its kind. And God saw\r\nthat it was good.\r\n13 And the evening and the morning were the\r\nthird day.\r\n14 And God said: Let there be lights made\r\nin the firmament of heaven, to divide the day\r\nand the night, and let them be for signs, and for\r\nseasons, and for days and years:\r\n15 To shine in the firmament of heaven, and\r\nto give light upon the earth, and it was so done.\r\n16 And God made two great lights: a greater\r\nlight to rule the day; and a lesser light to rule\r\nthe night: and The stars.\r\n17 And he set them in the firmament of heaven\r\nto shine upon the earth.\r\n18 And to rule the day and the night, and to\r\ndivide the light and the darkness. And God saw\r\nthat it was good.\r\n19 And the evening and morning were the\r\nfourth day.\r\n20 God also said: let the waters bring forth\r\nthe creeping creature having life, and the fowl\r\nthat may fly over the earth under the firmament\r\nof heaven.\r\n21 And God created the great whales, and\r\nevery living and moving creature, which the\r\nwaaters brought forth, according to their kinds,\r\nand every winged fowl according to its kind. And\r\nGod saw that it was good.\r\n4 Book of Genesis\r\n22 And he blessed them, saying: Increase and\r\nmultiply, and fill the waters of the sea: and let\r\nthe birds be multiplied upon the earth.\r\n23 And the evening and morning were the fifth\r\nday.\r\n24 And God said: Let the earth bring forth\r\nthe living creature in its kind, cattle and creeping\r\nthings, and beasts of the earth, according to their\r\nkinds. And it was so done.\r\n25 And God made the beasts of the earth\r\naccording to their kinds, and cattle, and every\r\nthing that creepeth on the earth after its kind.\r\nAnd God saw that it was good.\r\n26 And he said: Let us make man to our image\r\nand likeness: and let him have dominion over the\r\nfishes of the sea, and the fowls of the air, and the\r\nbeasts, and the whole earth, and every creeping\r\ncreature that moveth upon the earth.\r\n27 And God created man to his own image:\r\nto the image of God he created him: male and\r\nfemale he created them.\r\n28 And God blessed them, saying: Increase\r\nand multiply, and fill the earth, and subdue it,\r\nand rule over the fishes of the sea, and the fowls\r\nof the air, and all living creatures that move\r\nupon the earth.\r\n29 And God said: Behold I have given you\r\nevery herb bearing seed upon the earth, and all\r\ntrees that have in themselves seed of their own\r\nkind, to be your meat:\r\n30 And to all beasts of the earth, and to every\r\nfowl of the air, and to all that move upon the\r\nearth, and wherein there is life, that they may\r\nhave to feed upon. And it was so done.\r\n31 And God saw all the things that he had\r\nmade, and they were very good. And the evening\r\nand morning were the sixth day.\r\nChapter 2\r\nSo the heavens and the earth were finished, and\r\nall the furniture of them.\r\n2 And on the seventh day God ended his work\r\nwhich he had made: and he rested on the seventh\r\nday from all his work which he had done.\r\n3 And he blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because in it he had rested from all his\r\nwork which God created and made.\r\n4 These are the generations of the heaven and\r\nthe earth, when they were created, in the day\r\nthat the Lord God made the heaven and the\r\nearth:\r\n5 And every plant of the field before it sprung\r\nup in the earth, and every herb of the ground\r\nbefore it grew: for the Lord God had not rained\r\nupon the earth; and there was not a man to till\r\nthe earth.\r\n6 But a spring rose out of the earth, watering\r\nall the surface of the earth.\r\n7 And the Lord God formed man of the slime\r\nof the earth: and breathed into his face the\r\nbreath of life, and man became a living soul.\r\n8 And the Lord God had planted a paradise of\r\npleasure from the beginning: wherein he placed\r\nman whom he had formed.\r\n9 And the Lord God brought forth of the\r\nground all manner of trees, fair to behold, and\r\npleasant to eat of: the tree of life also in the\r\nmidst of paradise: and the tree of knowledge of\r\ngood and evil.\r\n10 And a river went out of the place of pleasure to water paradise, which from thence is divided into four heads.\r\n11 The name of the one is Phison: that is it\r\nwhich compasseth all the land of Hevilath, where\r\ngold groweth.\r\n12 And the gold of that land is very good:\r\nthere is\r\n13 And the name of the second river is Gehon:\r\nthe same is it that compasseth all the land of\r\nEthiopia.\r\n14 And the name of the third river is Tigris:\r\nthe same passeth along by the Assyrians. And\r\nthe fourth river is Euphrates.\r\n15 And the Lord God took man, and put him\r\ninto the paradise of pleasure, to dress it, and to\r\nkeep it.\r\n16 And he commanded him, saying: Of every\r\ntree of paradise thou shalt eat:\r\n17 But of the tree of knowledge of good and\r\nevil, thou shalt not eat. For in what day soever\r\nthou shalt eat of it, thou shalt die the death.\r\n18 And the Lord God said: It is not good for\r\nman to be alone: let us make him a help like\r\nunto himself.\r\n19 And the Lord God having formed out of\r\nthe ground all the beasts of the earth, and all\r\nthe fowls of the air, brought them to Adam to see\r\nwhat he would call them: for whatsoever Adam\r\ncalled any living creature the same is its name.\r\n20 And Adam called all the beasts by their\r\nnames, and all the fowls of the air, and all the\r\ncattle of the field: but for Adam there was not\r\nfound a helper like himself.\r\n21 Then the Lord God cast a deep sleep upon\r\nAdam: and when he was fast asleep, he took one\r\nof his ribs, and filled up flesh for it.\r\n22 And the Lord God built the rib which he\r\ntook from Adam into a woman: and brought her\r\nto Adam.\r\n23 And Adam said: This now is bone of my\r\nbones, and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called\r\nwoman, because she was taken out of man.\r\n24 Wherefore a man shall leave father and\r\nmother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they\r\nshall be two in one flesh.\r\n25 And they were both naked: to wit, Adam\r\nand his wife: and were not ashamed.\r\nChapter 3\r\nNow the serpent was more subtle tha any of the\r\nbeasts of the earth which the Lord God had\r\nmade. And he said to the woman: Why hath\r\nGod commanded you, that you should not eat\r\nof every tree of paradise?\r\n2 And the woman answered him, saying: Of\r\nthe fruit of the trees that are in paradise we do\r\neat:\r\n3 But of the fruit of the tree which is in the\r\nmidst of paradise, God hath commanded us that\r\nwe should not eat; and that we should not touch\r\nit, lest perhaps we die.\r\n4 And the serpent said to the woman: No, you\r\nshall not die the death.\r\n5 For God doth know that in what day soever\r\nyou shall eat thereof, your eyes shall be opened:\r\nand you shall be as Gods, knowing good and evil.\r\n6 And the woman saw that the tree was good\r\nto eat, and fair to the eyes, and delightful to\r\nbehold: and she took of the fruit thereof, and\r\ndid eat, and gave to her husband, who did eat.\r\n7 And the eyes of them both were opened:\r\nand when they perceived themselves to be naked,\r\nthey sewed together fig leaves, and made themselves aprons.\r\n8 And when they heard the voice of the Lord\r\nGod walking in paradise at the afternoon air,\r\nAdam and his wife hid themselves from the face\r\nof the Lord God, amidst the trees of paradise.\r\n9 And the Lord God called Adam, and said to\r\nhim: Where art thou?\r\n10 And he said: I heard thy voice in paradise;\r\nand I was afraid, because I was naked, and I hid\r\nmyself.\r\n11 And he said to him: And who hath told\r\nthee that thou wast naked, but that thou hast\r\neaten of the tree whereof I commanded thee that\r\nthou shouldst not eat?\r\n6 Book of Genesis\r\n12 And Adam said: The woman, whom thou\r\ngavest me to be my companion, gave me of the\r\ntree, and I did eat.\r\n13 And the Lord God said to the woman: Why\r\nhast thou done this? And she answered: The\r\nserpent deceived me, and I did eat.\r\n14 And the Lord God said to the serpent: Because thou hast done this thing, thou art cursed\r\namong all cattle, and beasts of the earth: upon\r\nthy breast shalt thou go, and earth shalt thou\r\neat all the days of thy life.\r\n15 I will put enmities between thee and the\r\nwoman, and thy seed and her seed: she shall\r\ncursh thy head, and thou shalt lie in wait for her\r\nheel.\r\n16 To the woman also he said: I will multiply thy sorrows, and thy conceptions: in sorrow\r\nshalt thou bring forth children, and thou shalt\r\nbe under thy husband\u2019s power, and he shall have\r\ndominion over thee.\r\n17 And to Adam he said: Because thou hast\r\nhearkened to the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten\r\nof the tree, whereof I commanded thee, that thou\r\nshouldst not eat, cursed is the earth in thy work:\r\nwith labour and toil shalt thou eat thereof all the\r\ndays of thy life.\r\n18 Thorns and thistles shall it bring forth to\r\nthee, and thou shalt eat the herbs of the earth.\r\n19 In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread\r\ntill thou return to the earth out of which thou\r\nwast taken: for dust thou art, and into dust thou\r\nshalt return.\r\n20 And Adam called the name of his wife Eve:\r\nbecause she was the mother of all the living.\r\n21 And the Lord God made for Adam and his\r\nwife garments of skins, and clothed them.\r\n22 And he said: Behold Adam is become as\r\none of us, knowing good and evil: now therefore\r\nlest perhaps he put forth his hand and take also\r\nof the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever.\r\n23 And the Lord God sent him out of the paradise of pleasure, to till the earth from which he\r\nwas taken.\r\n24 And he cast out Adam: and placed before\r\nthe paradise of pleasure Cherubims, and a flaming sword, turning every way, to keep the way of\r\nthe tree of life.\r\nChapter 4\r\nAnd Adam knew Eve his wife; who conceived\r\nand brought forth Cain, saying: I have gotten a\r\nman through God.\r\n2 And again she brought forth his brother\r\nAbel. And Abel was a shepherd, and Cain a\r\nhusbandman.\r\n3 And it came to pass after many days, that\r\nCain offered, of the fruits of the earth, gifts to\r\nthe Lord.\r\n4 Abel also offered of the firstlings of his flock,\r\nand of their fat: and the Lord had respect to\r\nAbel, and to his offerings.\r\n5 But to Cain and his offerings he had no respect: and Cain was exceeding angry, and his\r\ncountenance fell.\r\n6 And the Lord said to him: Why art thou\r\nangry? and why is thy countenance fallen?\r\n7 If thou do well, shalt thou not receive? but\r\nif ill, shall not sin forthwith be present at the\r\ndoor? but the lust thereof shall be under thee,\r\nand thou shalt have dominion over it.\r\n8 And Cain said to Abel his brother: Let us go\r\nforth abroad. And when they were in the field,\r\nCain rose up against his brother Abel, and slew\r\nhim.\r\n9 And the Lord said to Cain: Where is thy\r\nbrother Abel? And he answered: I know not:\r\nam I my brother\u2019s keeper?\r\n10 And he said to him: What hast thou done?\r\nBook of Genesis 7\r\nthe voice of thy brother\u2019s blood crieth to me from\r\nthe earth.\r\n11 Now therefore cursed shalt thou be upon\r\nthe earth, which hath opened her mouth and recieved the blood of thy brother at thy hand.\r\n12 When thou shalt till it, it shall not yield\r\nto thee its fruit: a fugitive and a vagabond shalt\r\nthou be upon the earth.\r\n13 And Cain said to the Lord: My iniquity is\r\ngreater than that I may deserve pardon.\r\n14 Behold thou dost cast me out this day from\r\nthe face of the earth, and from thy face I shall be\r\nhid, and I shall be a vagabond and a fugitive on\r\nthe earth: every one therefore that findeth me,\r\nshall kill me.\r\n15 And the Lord said to him: No, it shall\r\nnot so be: but whosoever shall kill Cain, shall\r\nbe punished sevenfold. And the Lord set a mark\r\nupon Cain, that whosoever found him should not\r\nkill him.\r\n16 And Cain went out from the face of the\r\nLord, and dwelt as a fugitive on the earth at the\r\neast side of Eden.\r\n17 And Cain knew his wife, and she conceived,\r\nand brought forth Henoch: and he built a city,\r\nand called the name thereof by the name of his\r\nson Henoch.\r\n18 And Henoch begot Irad, and Irad begot Maviael, and Maviael begot Mathusael, and\r\nMathusael begot Lamech,\r\n19 Who took two wives: the name of the one\r\nwas Ada, and the name of the other Sella.\r\n20 And Ada brought forth Jabel: who was the\r\nfather of such as dwell in tents, and of herdsmen.\r\n21 And his brother\u2019s name was Jubal: he was\r\nthe father of them that play upon the harp and\r\nthe organs.\r\n22 Sella also brought forth Tubalcain, who\r\nwas a hammerer and artificer in every work of\r\nbrass and iron. And the sister of Tubalcain was\r\nNoema.\r\n23 And Lamech said to his wives Ada and\r\nSella: Hear my voice, ye wives of Lamech, hearken to my speech: for I have slain a man to the\r\nwounding of myself, and a stripling to my own\r\nbruising.\r\n24 Sevenfold vengeance shall be taken for\r\nCain: but for Lamech seventy times sevenfold.\r\n25 Adam also knew his wife again: and she\r\nbrought forth a son, and called his name Seth,\r\nsaying: God hath given me another seed for\r\nAbel, whom Cain slew.\r\n26 But to Seth also was born a son, whom\r\nhe called Enos: this man began to call upon the\r\nname of the Lord.\r\nChapter 5\r\nThis is the book of the generation of Adam. In\r\nthe day that God created man, he made him to\r\nthe likeness of God.\r\n2 He created them male and female; and\r\nblessed them: and called their name Adam, in\r\nthe day when they were created.\r\n3 And Adam lived a hundred and thirty years,\r\nand begot a son to his own image and likeness,\r\nand called his name Seth.\r\n4 And the days of Adam, after he begot Seth,\r\nwere eight hundred years: and he begot sons and\r\ndaughters.\r\n5 And all the time that Adam lived, came to\r\nnine hundred and thirty years, and he died.\r\n6 Seth also lived a hundred and five years, and\r\nbegot Enos.\r\n7 And Seth lived after he begot Enos, eight\r\nhundred and seven years, and begot sons and\r\ndaughters.\r\n8 Book of Genesis\r\n8 And all the days of Seth were nine hundred\r\nand twelve years, and he died.\r\n9 And Enos lived ninety years, and begot\r\nCainan.\r\n10 After whose birth he lived eight hundred\r\nand fifteen years, and begot sons and daughters.\r\n11 And all the days of Enos were nine hundred\r\nand five years, and he died.\r\n12 And Cainan lived seventy years, and begot\r\nMalaleel.\r\n13 And Cainan lived after he begot Malaleel,\r\neight hundred and forty years, and begot sons\r\nand daughters.\r\n14 And all the days of Cainan were nine hundred and ten years, and he died.\r\n15 And Malaleel lived sixty-five years and begot Jared.\r\n16 And Malaleel lived after he begot Jared,\r\neight hundred and thirty years, and begot sons\r\nand daughters.\r\n17 And all the days of Malaleel were eight\r\nhundred and ninety-five years, and he died.\r\n18 And Jared lived a hundred and sixty-two\r\nyears, and begot Henoch.\r\n19 And Jared lived after he begot Henoch,\r\neight hundred years, and begot sons and daughters.\r\n20 And all the days of Jared were nine hundred and sixty-two years, and he died.\r\n21 And Henoch lived sixty-five years, and begot Mathusala.\r\n22 And Henoch walked with God: and lived\r\nafter he begot Mathusala, three hundred years,\r\nand begot sons and daughters.\r\n23 And all the days of Henoch were three hundred and sixty-five years.\r\n24 And he walked with God, and was seen no\r\nmore: because God took him.\r\n25 And Mathusala lived a hundred and eightyseven years, and begot Lamech.\r\n26 And Mathlusala lived after he begot\r\nLamech, seven hundred and eighty-two years,\r\nand begot sons and daughters.\r\n27 And all the days of Mathusala were nine\r\nhundred and sixty-nine years, and he died.\r\n28 And Lamech lived a hundred and eightytwo years, and begot a son.\r\n29 And he called his name Noe, saying:\r\nThis same shall comfort us from the works and\r\nlabours of our hands on the earth, which the\r\nLord hath cursed.\r\n30 And Lamech lived after he begot Noe, five\r\nhundred and ninety-five years, and begot sons\r\nand daughters.\r\n31 And all the days of Lamech came to seven\r\nhundred and seventy-seven years, and he died.\r\nAnd Noe, when he was five hundred years old,\r\nbegot Sem, Cham, and Japheth.\r\nChapter 6\r\nAnd after that men began to be multiplied upon\r\nthe earth, and daughters were born to them,\r\n2 The sons of God seeing the daughters of\r\nmen, that they were fair, took to themselves\r\nwives of all which they chose.\r\n3 And God said: My spirit shall not remain\r\nin man for ever, because he is flesh, and his days\r\nshall be a hundred and twenty years.\r\n4 Now giants were upon the earth in those\r\ndays. For after the sons of God went in to the\r\ndaughters of men, and they brought forth children, these are the mighty men of old, men of\r\nrenown.\r\n5 And God seeing that the wickedness of men\r\nwas great on the earth, and that all the thought\r\nof their heart was bent upon evil at all times,\r\n6 It repented him that he had made man on\r\nthe earth. And being touched inwardly with sor-\r\nBook of Genesis 9\r\nrow of heart,\r\n7 He said: I will destroy man, whom I have\r\ncreated, from the face of the earth, from man\r\neven to beasts, from the creeping thing even to\r\nthe fowls of the air, for it repenteth me that I\r\nhave made them.\r\n8 But Noe found grace before the Lord.\r\n9 These are the generations of Noe: Noe was\r\na just and perfect man in his generations, he\r\nwalked with God.\r\n10 And he begot three sons, Sem, Cham, and\r\nJapheth.\r\n11 And the earth was corrupted before God,\r\nand was filled with iniquity.\r\n12 And when God had seen that the earth\r\nwas corrupted (for all flesh had corrupted its way\r\nupon the earth),\r\n13 He said to Noe: The end of all flesh is\r\ncome before me, the earth is filled with iniquity\r\nthrough them, and I will destroy them with the\r\nearth.\r\n14 Make thee an ark of timber planks: thou\r\nshalt make little rooms in the ark, and thou shalt\r\npitch it within and without.\r\n15 And thus shalt thou make it. The length\r\nof the ark shall be three hundred cubits: the\r\nbreadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it\r\nthirty cubits.\r\n16 Thou shalt make a window in the ark, and\r\nin a cubit shalt thou finish the top of it: and the\r\ndoor of the ark thou shalt set in the side: with\r\nlower, middle chambers, and third stories shalt\r\nthou make it.\r\n17 Behold, I will bring the waters of a great\r\nflood upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein\r\nis the breath of life under heaven. All things that\r\nare in the earth shall be consumed.\r\n18 And I will establish my covenant with thee,\r\nand thou shalt enter into the ark, thou and thy\r\nsons, and thy wife, and the wives of thy sons\r\nwith thee.\r\n19 And of every living creature of all flesh,\r\nthou shalt bring two of a sort into the ark, that\r\nthey may live with thee: of the male sex, and\r\nthe female.\r\n20 Of fowls according to their kind, and of\r\nbeasts in their kind, and of every thing that\r\ncreepeth on the earth according to its kind: two\r\nof every sort shall go in with thee, that they may\r\nlive.\r\n21 Thou shalt take unto thee of all food that\r\nmay be eaten, and thou shalt lay it up with thee:\r\nand it shall be food for thee and them.\r\n22 And Noe did all things which God commanded him.\r\nChapter 7\r\nAnd the Lord said to him: Go in, thou and all\r\nthy house, into the ark: for thee I have seen just\r\nbefore me in this generation.\r\n2 Of all clean beasts take seven and seven, the\r\nmale and the female.\r\n3 But of the beasts that are unclean two and\r\ntwo, the male and the female. Of the fowls also\r\nof the air seven and seven, the male and the female: that seed may be saved upon the face of\r\nthe whole earth.\r\n4 For yet a while, and after seven days, I will\r\nrain upon the earth forty days and forty nights:\r\nand I will destroy every substance that I have\r\nmade, from the face of the earth.\r\n5 And Noe did all things which the Lord had\r\ncommanded him.\r\n6 And he was six hundred years old, when the\r\nwaters of the flood overflowed the earth.\r\n7 And Noe went in and his sons, his wife and\r\nthe wives of his sons with him into the ark, be-\r\n10 Book of Genesis\r\ncause of the waters of the flood.\r\n8 And of beasts clean and unclean, and of\r\nfowls, and of every thing that moveth upon the\r\nearth,\r\n9 Two and two went in to Noe into the ark,\r\nmale and female, as the Lord had commanded\r\nNoe.\r\n10 And after the seven days were passed, the\r\nwaters of the flood overflowed the earth.\r\n11 In the six hundredth year of the life of Noe,\r\nin the second month, in the seventeenth day of\r\nthe month, all the fountains of the great deep\r\nwere broken up, and the floodgates of heaven\r\nwere opened:\r\n12 And the rain fell upon the earth forty days\r\nand forty nights.\r\n13 In the selfsame day Noe, and Sem, and\r\nCham, and Japheth, his sons: his wife, and the\r\nthree wives of his sons with them, went into the\r\nark.\r\n14 They and every beast according to its kind,\r\nand all the cattle in their kind, and every thing\r\nthat moveth upon the earth, according to its\r\nkind, and every fowl according to its kind, all\r\nbirds, and all that fly,\r\n15 Went in to Noe into the ark, two and two\r\nof all flesh, wherein was the breath of life.\r\n16 And they that went in, went in male and\r\nfemale of all flesh, as God had commanded him:\r\nand the Lord shut him in on the outside.\r\n17 And the flood was forty days upon the\r\nearth: and the waters increased, and lifted up\r\nthe ark on high from the earth.\r\n18 For they overflowed exceedingly: and filled\r\nall on the face of the earth: and the ark was\r\ncarried upon the waters.\r\n19 And the waters prevailed beyond measure\r\nupon the earth: and all the high mountains under the whole heaven were covered.\r\n20 The water was fifteen cubits higher than\r\nthe mountains which it covered.\r\n21 And all flesh was destroyed that moved\r\nupon the earth, both of fowl and of cattle, and\r\nof beasts, and of all creeping things that creep\r\nupon the earth: and all men.\r\n22 And all th\r\n11 In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.2 And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.\r\n\r\n3 And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.4 And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness.5 And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.\r\n\r\n6 And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.7 And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.8 And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day.\r\n\r\n9 And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.10 And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.11 And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.12 And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good.13 And the evening and the morning were the third day.\r\n\r\n14 And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:15 And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.16 And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.17 And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth,18 And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.19 And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.\r\n\r\n20 And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.21 And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.22 And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.23 And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.\r\n\r\n24 And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.25 And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good.\r\n\r\n26 And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.27 So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.28 And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.\r\n\r\n29 And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.30 And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.31 And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.21 Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.2 And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.3 And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.\r\n\r\n4 These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens,5 And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew: for the Lord God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till the ground.6 But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.7 And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.\r\n\r\n8 And the Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed.9 And out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.10 And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads.11 The name of the first is Pison: that is it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;12 And the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the onyx stone.13 And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia.14 And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which goeth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river is Euphrates.15 And the Lord God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.\r\n\r\n16 And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat:17 But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.\r\n\r\n18 And the Lord God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him.19 And out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was the name thereof.20 And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found an help meet for him.\r\n\r\n21 And the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof;22 And the rib, which the Lord God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man.23 And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.24 Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.25 And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.31 Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?2 And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:3 But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.4 And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:5 For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.\r\n\r\n6 And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.7 And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.8 And they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the trees of the garden.\r\n\r\n9 And the Lord God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where art thou?10 And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.\r\n\r\n11 And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?12 And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.13 And the Lord God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.\r\n\r\n14 And the Lord God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:15 And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.16 Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.\r\n\r\n17 And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;18 Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field;19 In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.20 And Adam called his wife's name Eve; because she was the mother of all living.21 Unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins, and clothed them.\r\n\r\n22 And the Lord God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:23 Therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.24 So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.41 And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and said, I have gotten a man from the Lord.2 And she again bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.\r\n\r\n3 And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the Lord.4 And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the Lord had respect unto Abel and to his offering:5 But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.\r\n\r\n6 And the Lord said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen?7 If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto thee shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.8 And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.\r\n\r\n9 And the Lord said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not: Am I my brother's keeper?10 And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground.11 And now art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand;12 When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.\r\n\r\n13 And Cain said unto the Lord, My punishment is greater than I can bear.14 Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me.15 And the Lord said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And the Lord set a mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him.\r\n\r\n16 And Cain went out from the presence of the Lord, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.17 And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch.18 And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and Mehujael begat Methusael: and Methusael begat Lamech.\r\n\r\n19 And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.20 And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents, and of such as have cattle.21 And his brother's name was Jubal: he was the father of all such as handle the harp and organ.22 And Zillah, she also bare Tubal\u2013cain, an instructer of every artificer in brass and iron: and the sister of Tubal\u2013cain was Naamah.\r\n\r\n23 And Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice; ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech: for I have slain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt.24 If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold.\r\n\r\n25 And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called his name Seth: For God, said she, hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew.26 And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enos: then began men to call upon the name of the Lord.51 This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that God created man, in the likeness of God made he him;2 Male and female created he them; and blessed them, and called their name Adam, in the day when they were created.\r\n\r\n3 And Adam lived an hundred and thirty years, and begat a son in his own likeness, after his image; and called his name Seth:4 And the days of Adam after he had begotten Seth were eight hundred years: and he begat sons and daughters:5 And all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years: and he died.\r\n\r\n6 And Seth lived an hundred and five years, and begat Enos:7 And Seth lived after he begat Enos eight hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters:8 And all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years: and he died.\r\n\r\n9 And Enos lived ninety years, and begat Cainan:10 And Enos lived after he begat Cainan eight hundred and fifteen years, and begat sons and daughters:11 And all the days of Enos were nine hundred and five years: and he died.\r\n\r\n12 And Cainan lived seventy years, and begat Mahalaleel:13 And Cainan lived after he begat Mahalaleel eight hundred and forty years, and begat sons and daughters:14 And all the days of Cainan were nine hundred and ten years: and he died.\r\n\r\n15 And Mahalaleel lived sixty and five years, and begat Jared:16 And Mahalaleel lived after he begat Jared eight hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters:17 And all the days of Mahalaleel were eight hundred ninety and five years: and he died.\r\n\r\n18 And Jared lived an hundred sixty and two years, and he begat Enoch:19 And Jared lived after he begat Enoch eight hundred years, and begat sons and daughters:20 And all the days of Jared were nine hundred sixty and two years: and he died.\r\n\r\n21 And Enoch lived sixty and five years, and begat Methuselah:22 And Enoch walked with God after he begat Methuselah three hundred years, and begat sons and daughters:23 And all the days of Enoch were three hundred sixty and five years:24 And Enoch walked with God: and he was not; for God took him.\r\n\r\n25 And Methuselah lived an hundred eighty and seven years, and begat Lamech:26 And Methuselah lived after he begat Lamech seven hundred eighty and two years, and begat sons and daughters:27 And all the days of Methuselah were nine hundred sixty and nine years: and he died.\r\n\r\n28 And Lamech lived an hundred eighty and two years, and begat a son:29 And he called his name Noah, saying, This same shall comfort us concerning our work and toil of our hands, because of the ground which the Lord hath cursed.30 And Lamech lived after he begat Noah five hundred ninety and five years, and begat sons and daughters:31 And all the days of Lamech were seven hundred seventy and seven years: and he died.32 And Noah was five hundred years old: and Noah begat Shem, Ham, and Japheth.61 And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them,2 That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.3 And the Lord said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.\r\n\r\n4 There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.\r\n\r\n5 And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.\r\n\r\n6 And it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.7 And the Lord said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.\r\n\r\n8 But Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord.\r\n\r\n9 These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God.10 And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.\r\n\r\n11 The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence.12 And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.\r\n\r\n13 And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth.\r\n\r\n14 Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.15 And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.16 A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it.17 And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; and every thing that is in the earth shall die.18 But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee.19 And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female.20 Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive.21 And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them.22 Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so did he.71 And the Lord said unto Noah, Come thou and all thy house into the ark; for thee have I seen righteous before me in this generation.2 Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens, the male and his female: and of beasts that are not clean by two, the male and his female.3 Of fowls also of the air by sevens, the male and the female; to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth.4 For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights; and every living substance that I have made will I destroy from off the face of the earth.\r\n\r\n5 And Noah did according unto all that the Lord commanded him.6 And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was upon the earth.\r\n\r\n7 And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.8 Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of fowls, and of every thing that creepeth upon the earth,9 There went in two and two unto Noah into the ark, the male and the female, as God had commanded Noah.10 And it came to pass after seven days, that the waters of the flood were upon the earth.\r\n\r\n11 In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened.12 And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights.\r\n\r\n13 In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, into the ark;14 They, and every beast after his kind, and all the cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind, and every fowl after his kind, every bird of every sort.15 And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two of all flesh, wherein is the breath of life.16 And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God had commanded him: and the Lord shut him in.\r\n\r\n17 And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth.18 And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters.19 And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered.20 Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains were covered.\r\n\r\n21 And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man:22 All in whose nostrils was the breath of life, of all that was in the dry land, died.23 And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark.24 And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty days.81 And God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the cattle that was with him in the ark: and God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters asswaged;2 The fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained;3 And the waters returned from off the earth continually: and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were abated.\r\n\r\n4 And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat.5 And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month: in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, were the tops of the mountains seen.\r\n\r\n6 And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made:7 And he sent forth a raven, which went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up from off the earth.8 Also he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground;9 But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him into the ark, for the waters were on the face of the whole earth: then he put forth his hand, and took her, and pulled her in unto him into the ark.10 And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark;11 And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf pluckt off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth.12 And he stayed yet other seven days; and sent forth the dove; which returned not again unto him any more.\r\n\r\n13 And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry.14 And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, was the earth dried.\r\n\r\n15 And God spake unto Noah, saying,16 Go forth of the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons' wives with thee.17 Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, of all flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.18 And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him:19 Every beast, every creeping thing, and every fowl, and whatsoever creepeth upon the earth, after their kinds, went forth out of the ark.\r\n\r\n20 And Noah builded an altar unto the Lord; and took of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the altar.21 And the Lord smelled a sweet savour; and the Lord said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake; for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth; neither will I again smite any more every thing living, as I have done.22 While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease.91 And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.2 And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered.3 Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as the green herb have I given you all things.4 But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall ye not eat.5 And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man.6 Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man.7 And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly in the earth, and multiply therein.\r\n\r\n8 And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying,9 And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you;10 And with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth.11 And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.\r\n\r\n12 And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations:13 I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth.14 And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud:15 And I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.16 And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.17 And God said unto Noah, This is the token of the covenant, which I have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth.\r\n\r\n18 And the sons of Noah, that went forth of the ark, were Shem, and Ham, and Japheth: and Ham is the father of Canaan.19 These are the three sons of Noah: and of them was the whole earth overspread.20 And Noah began to be an husbandman, and he planted a vineyard:21 And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered within his tent.22 And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without.23 And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness.\r\n\r\n24 And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had done unto him.25 And he said, Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren.26 And he said, Blessed be the Lord God of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.27 God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.\r\n\r\n28 And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.29 And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years: and he died.101 Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham, and Japheth: and unto them were sons born after the flood.2 The sons of Japheth; Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras.3 And the sons of Gomer; Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah.4 And the sons of Javan; Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.5 By these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their lands; every one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations.\r\n\r\n6 And the sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and Canaan.7 And the sons of Cush; Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabtecha: and the sons of Raamah; Sheba, and Dedan.8 And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth.9 He was a mighty hunter before the Lord: wherefore it is said, Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the Lord.10 And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.11 Out of that land went forth Asshur, and builded Nineveh, and the city Rehoboth, and Calah,12 And Resen between Nineveh and Calah: the same is a great city.13 And Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim,14 And Pathrusim, and Casluhim, (out of whom came Philistim,) and Caphtorim.\r\n\r\n15 And Canaan begat Sidon his firstborn, and Heth,16 And the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgasite,17 And the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite,18 And the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite: and afterward were the families of the Canaanites spread abroad.19 And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as thou comest to Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou goest, unto Sodom, and Gomorrah, and Admah, and Zeboim, even unto Lasha.20 These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their tongues, in their countries, and in their nations.\r\n\r\n21 Unto Shem also, the father of all the children of Eber, the brother of Japheth the elder, even to him were children born.22 The children of Shem; Elam, and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and Lud, and Aram.23 And the children of Aram; Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash.24 And Arphaxad begat Salah; and Salah begat Eber.25 And unto Eber were born two sons: the name of one was Peleg; for in his days was the earth divided; and his brother's name was Joktan.26 And Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and Jerah,27 And Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah,28 And Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba,29 And Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab: all these were the sons of Joktan.30 And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest unto Sephar a mount of the east.31 These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, after their nations.32 These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.111 And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech.2 And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there.3 And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and burn them throughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for morter.4 And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.\r\n\r\n5 And the Lord came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded.6 And the Lord said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do.7 Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech.8 So the Lord scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off to build the city.9 Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the Lord did there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did the Lord scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.\r\n\r\n10 These are the generations of Shem: Shem was an hundred years old, and begat Arphaxad two years after the flood:11 And Shem lived after he begat Arphaxad five hundred years, and begat sons and daughters.12 And Arphaxad lived five and thirty years, and begat Salah:13 And Arphaxad lived after he begat Salah four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters.14 And Salah lived thirty years, and begat Eber:15 And Salah lived after he begat Eber four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters.16 And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begat Peleg:17 And Eber lived after he begat Peleg four hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters.18 And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu:19 And Peleg lived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years, and begat sons and daughters.20 And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug:21 And Reu lived after he begat Serug two hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters.22 And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nahor:23 And Serug lived after he begat Nahor two hundred years, and begat sons and daughters.24 And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Terah:25 And Nahor lived after he begat Terah an hundred and nineteen years, and begat sons and daughters.26 And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran.\r\n\r\n27 Now these are the generations of Terah: Terah begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran begat Lot.28 And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees.29 And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram's wife was Sarai; and the name of Nahor's wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah.30 But Sarai was barren; she had no child.31 And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there.32 And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and Terah died in Haran.121 Now the Lord had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will shew thee:2 And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:3 And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.\r\n\r\n4 So Abram departed, as the Lord had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran.5 And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.\r\n\r\n6 And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Sichem, unto the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.7 And the Lord appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the Lord, who appeared unto him.8 And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Beth\u2013el, and pitched his tent, having Beth\u2013el on the west, and Hai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the Lord, and called upon the name of the Lord.9 And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south.\r\n\r\n10 And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the land.11 And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon:12 Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.13 Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.\r\n\r\n14 And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.15 The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.16 And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels.17 And the Lord plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai Abram's wife.18 And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What is this that thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?19 Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way.20 And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had.131 And Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the south.2 And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold.3 And he went on his journeys from the south even to Beth\u2013el, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Beth\u2013el and Hai;4 Unto the place of the altar, which he had made there at the first: and there Abram called on the name of the Lord.\r\n\r\n5 And Lot also, which went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents.6 And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together.7 And there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram's cattle and the herdmen of Lot's cattle: and the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelled then in the land.8 And Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen; for we be brethren.9 Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left.\r\n\r\n10 And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan, that it was well watered every where, before the Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, even as the garden of the Lord, like the land of Egypt, as thou comest unto Zoar.11 Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed east: and they separated themselves the one from the other.12 Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelled in the cities of the plain, and pitched his tent toward Sodom.13 But the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the Lord exceedingly.\r\n\r\n14 And the Lord said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated from him, Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward:15 For all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for ever.16 And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered.17 Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it; for I will give it unto thee.18 Then Abram removed his tent, and came and dwelt in the plain of Mamre, which is in Hebron, and built there an altar unto the Lord.141 And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of nations;2 That these made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar.3 All these were joined together in the vale of Siddim, which is the salt sea.4 Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth year they rebelled.5 And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that were with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emims in Shaveh Kiriathaim,6 And the Horites in their mount Seir, unto El\u2013paran, which is by the wilderness.7 And they returned, and came to En\u2013mishpat, which is Kadesh, and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelt in Hazezon\u2013tamar.8 And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar;) and they joined battle with them in the vale of Siddim;9 With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king of nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings with five.10 And the vale of Siddim was full of slimepits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that remained fled to the mountain.11 And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their victuals, and went their way.12 And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.\r\n\r\n13 And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner: and these were confederate with Abram.14 And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained servants, born in his own house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued them unto Dan.15 And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by night, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus.16 And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people.\r\n\r\n17 And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that were with him, at the valley of Shaveh, which is the king's dale.18 And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God.19 And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth:20 And blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all.\r\n\r\n21 And the king of Sodom said unto Abram, Give me the persons, and take the goods to thyself.22 And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand unto the Lord, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth,23 That I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and that I will not take any thing that is thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich:24 Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their portion.151 After these things the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward.\r\n\r\n2 And Abram said, Lord God, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?3 And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one born in my house is mine heir.4 And, behold, the word of the Lord came unto him, saying, This shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir.5 And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be.6 And he believed in the Lord; and he counted it to him for righteousness.\r\n\r\n7 And he said unto him, I am the Lord that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it.8 And he said, Lord God, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it?9 And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.10 And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not.11 And when the fowls came down upon the carcases, Abram drove them away.\r\n\r\n12 And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him.13 And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;14 And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance.15 And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age.16 But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.\r\n\r\n17 And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces.18 In the same day the Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates:19 The Kenites, and the Kenizzites, and the Kadmonites,20 And the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Rephaims,21 And the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.161 Now Sarai Abram's wife bare him no children: and she had an handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar.2 And Sarai said unto Abram, Behold now, the Lord hath restrained me from bearing: I pray thee, go in unto my maid; it may be that I may obtain children by her. And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai.3 And Sarai Abram's wife took Hagar her maid the Egyptian, after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife.\r\n\r\n4 And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.5 And Sarai said unto Abram, My wrong be upon thee: I have given my maid into thy bosom; and when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes: the Lord judge between me and thee.6 But Abram said unto Sarai, Behold, thy maid is in thy hand; do to her as it pleaseth thee. And when Sarai dealt hardly with her, she fled from her face.\r\n\r\n7 And the angel of the Lord found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur.8 And he said, Hagar, Sarai's maid, whence camest thou? and whither wilt thou go? And she said, I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai.9 And the angel of the Lord said unto her, Return to thy mistress, and submit thyself under her hands.\r\n\r\n10 And the angel of the Lord said unto her, I will multiply thy seed exceedingly, that it shall not be numbered for multitude.11 And the angel of the Lord said unto her, Behold, thou art with child, and shalt bear a son, and shalt call his name Ishmael; because the Lord hath heard thy affliction.12 And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man, and every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren.13 And she called the name of the Lord that spake unto her, Thou God seest me: for she said, Have I also here looked after him that seeth me?14 Wherefore the well was called Beer\u2013lahai\u2013roi; behold, it is between Kadesh and Bered.\r\n\r\n15 And Hagar bare Abram a son: and Abram called his son's name, which Hagar bare, Ishmael.16 And Abram was fourscore and six years old, when Hagar bare Ishmael to Abram.171 And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the Lord appeared to Abram, and said unto him, I am the Almighty God; walk before me, and be thou perfect.2 And I will make my covenant between me and thee, and will multiply thee exceedingly.3 And Abram fell on his face: and God talked with him, saying,\r\n\r\n4 As for me, behold, my covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be a father of many nations.5 Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name shall be Abraham; for a father of many nations have I made thee.6 And I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I will make nations of thee, and kings shall come out of thee.\r\n\r\n7 And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee.8 And I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land wherein thou art a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession; and I will be their God.\r\n\r\n9 And God said unto Abraham, Thou shalt keep my covenant therefore, thou, and thy seed after thee in their generations.10 This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised.11 And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall be a token of the covenant betwixt me and you.12 And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every man child in your generations, he that is born in the house, or bought with money of any stranger, which is not of thy seed.13 He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.14 And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken my covenant.\r\n\r\n15 And God said unto Abraham, As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt not call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall her name be.16 And I will bless her, and give thee a son also of her: yea, I will bless her, and she shall be a mother of nations; kings of people shall be of her.17 Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?18 And Abraham said unto God, O that Ishmael might live before thee!19 And God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, and with his seed after him.20 And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation.21 But my covenant will I establish with Isaac, which Sarah shall bear unto thee at this set time in the next year.22 And he left off talking with him, and God went up from Abraham.\r\n\r\n23 And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham's house; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God had said unto him.24 And Abraham was ninety years old and nine, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.25 And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.26 In the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his son.27 And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought with money of the stranger, were circumcised with him.181 And the Lord appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre: and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day;2 And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground,3 And said, My Lord, if now I have found favour in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant:4 Let a little water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree:5 And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort ye your hearts; after that ye shall pass on: for therefore are ye come to your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said.6 And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes upon the hearth.7 And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetcht a calf tender and good, and gave it unto a young man; and he hasted to dress it.8 And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.\r\n\r\n9 And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent.10 And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind him.11 Now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age; and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.12 Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?13 And the Lord said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, which am old?14 Is any thing too hard for the Lord? At the time appointed I will return unto thee, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son.15 Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh.\r\n\r\n16 And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way.17 And the Lord said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do;18 Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?19 For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the Lord, to do justice and judgment; that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him.20 And the Lord said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous;21 I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.22 And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the Lord.\r\n\r\n23 And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked?24 Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein?25 That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?26 And the Lord said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes.27 And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord, which am but dust and ashes:28 Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five? And he said, If I find there forty and five, I will not destroy it.29 And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for forty's sake.30 And he said unto him, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak: Peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he said, I will not do it, if I find thirty there.31 And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord: Peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for twenty's sake.32 And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for ten's sake.33 And the Lord went his way, as soon as he had left communing with Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place.191 And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground;2 And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on your ways. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night.3 And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did eat.\r\n\r\n4 But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from every quarter:5 And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them.6 And Lot went out at the door unto them, and shut the door after him,7 And said, I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly.8 Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof.9 And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man, even Lot, and came near to break the door.10 But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door.11 And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to find the door.\r\n\r\n12 And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the city, bring them out of this place:13 For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the Lord; and the Lord hath sent us to destroy it.14 And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the Lord will destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in law.\r\n\r\n15 And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.16 And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the Lord being merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the city.\r\n\r\n17 And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.18 And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my Lord:19 Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die:20 Behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little one: Oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and my soul shall live.21 And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which thou hast spoken.22 Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do any thing till thou be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.\r\n\r\n23 The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar.\r\n\r\n24 Then the Lord rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the Lord out of heaven;25 And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.\r\n\r\n26 But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.\r\n\r\n27 And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he stood before the Lord:28 And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace.\r\n\r\n29 And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt.\r\n\r\n30 And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters.31 And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth:32 Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.33 And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.34 And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.35 And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.36 Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father.37 And the firstborn bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same is the father of the Moabites unto this day.38 And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Ben\u2013ammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day.201 And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country, and dwelled between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar.2 And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister: and Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah.\r\n\r\n3 But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him, Behold, thou art but a dead man, for the woman which thou hast taken; for she is a man's wife.4 But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, Lord, wilt thou slay also a righteous nation?5 Said he not unto me, She is my sister? and she, even she herself said, He is my brother: in the integrity of my heart and innocency of my hands have I done this.6 And God said unto him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart; for I also withheld thee from sinning against me: therefore suffered I thee not to touch her.7 Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that are thine.\r\n\r\n8 Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were sore afraid.9 Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done.10 And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou hast done this thing?11 And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God is not in this place; and they will slay me for my wife's sake.12 And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.13 And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness which thou shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me, He is my brother.\r\n\r\n14 And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and womenservants, and gave them unto Abraham, and restored him Sarah his wife.15 And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before thee: dwell where it pleaseth thee.16 And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to thee a covering of the eyes, unto all that are with thee, and with all other: thus she was reproved.\r\n\r\n17 So Abraham prayed unto God: and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maidservants; and they bare children.18 For the Lord had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah Abraham's wife.211 And the Lord visited Sarah as he had said, and the Lord did unto Sarah as he had spoken.2 For Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him.3 And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him, whom Sarah bare to him, Isaac.4 And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac being eight days old, as God had commanded him.5 And Abraham was an hundred years old, when his son Isaac was born unto him.\r\n\r\n6 And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh, so that all that hear will laugh with me.7 And she said, Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah should have given children suck? for I have born him a son in his old age.8 And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great feast the same day that Isaac was weaned.\r\n\r\n9 And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had born unto Abraham, mocking.10 Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac.11 And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight because of his son.\r\n\r\n12 And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called.13 And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation, because he is thy seed.\r\n\r\n14 And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beer\u2013sheba.15 And the water was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs.16 And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off, as it were a bowshot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the child. And she sat over against him, and lift up her voice, and wept.17 And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is.18 Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I will make him a great nation.19 And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.20 And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the wilderness, and became an archer.21 And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt.\r\n\r\n22 And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all that thou doest:23 Now therefore swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son's son: but according to the kindness that I have done unto thee, thou shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned.24 And Abraham said, I will swear.25 And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water, which Abimelech's servants had violently taken away.26 And Abimelech said, I wot not who hath done this thing: neither didst thou tell me, neither yet heard I of it, but to day.27 And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech; and both of them made a covenant.28 And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.29 And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What mean these seven ewe lambs which thou hast set by themselves?30 And he said, For these seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that they may be a witness unto me, that I have digged this well.31 Wherefore he called that place Beer\u2013sheba; because there they sware both of them.32 Thus they made a covenant at Beer\u2013sheba: then Abimelech rose up, and Phichol the chief captain of his host, and they returned into the land of the Philistines.\r\n\r\n33 And Abraham planted a grove in Beer\u2013sheba, and called there on the name of the Lord, the everlasting God.34 And Abraham sojourned in the Philistines' land many days.221 And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am.2 And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.\r\n\r\n3 And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him.4 Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off.5 And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you.6 And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they went both of them together.7 And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?8 And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they went both of them together.9 And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.10 And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son.\r\n\r\n11 And the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I.12 And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me.13 And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son.14 And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah\u2013jireh: as it is said to this day, In the mount of the Lord it shall be seen.\r\n\r\n15 And the angel of the Lord called unto Abraham out of heaven the second time,16 And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the Lord, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son:17 That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;18 And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice.19 So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beer\u2013sheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beer\u2013sheba.\r\n\r\n20 And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also born children unto thy brother Nahor;21 Huz his firstborn, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram,22 And Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel.23 And Bethuel begat Rebekah: these eight Milcah did bear to Nahor, Abraham's brother.24 And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bare also Tebah, and Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah.231 And Sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years old: these were the years of the life of Sarah.2 And Sarah died in Kirjath\u2013arba; the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan: and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her.\r\n\r\n3 And Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spake unto the sons of Heth, saying,4 I am a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a possession of a buryingplace with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.5 And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying unto him,6 Hear us, my lord: thou art a mighty prince among us: in the choice of our sepulchres bury thy dead; none of us shall withhold from thee his sepulchre, but that thou mayest bury thy dead.7 And Abraham stood up, and bowed himself to the people of the land, even to the children of Heth.8 And he communed with them, saying, If it be your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight; hear me, and intreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar,9 That he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he hath, which is in the end of his field; for as much money as it is worth he shall give it me for a possession of a buryingplace amongst you.10 And Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth: and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the audience of the children of Heth, even of all that went in at the gate of his city, saying,11 Nay, my lord, hear me: the field give I thee, and the cave that is therein, I give it thee; in the presence of the sons of my people give I it thee: bury thy dead.12 And Abraham bowed down himself before the people of the land.13 And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, But if thou wilt give it, I pray thee, hear me: I will give thee money for the field; take it of me, and I will bury my dead there.14 And Ephron answered Abraham, saying unto him,15 My lord, hearken unto me: the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver; what is that betwixt me and thee? bury therefore thy dead.\r\n\r\n16 And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant.\r\n\r\n17 And the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all the borders round about, were made sure18 Unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city.19 And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre: the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan.20 And the field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure unto Abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of Heth.241 And Abraham was old, and well stricken in age: and the Lord had blessed Abraham in all things.2 And Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house, that ruled over all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh:3 And I will make thee swear by the Lord, the God of heaven, and the God of the earth, that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell:4 But thou shalt go unto my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son Isaac.5 And the servant said unto him, Peradventure the woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land: must I needs bring thy son again unto the land from whence thou camest?6 And Abraham said unto him, Beware thou that thou bring not my son thither again.\r\n\r\n7 The Lord God of heaven, which took me from my father's house, and from the land of my kindred, and which spake unto me, and that sware unto me, saying, Unto thy seed will I give this land; he shall send his angel before thee, and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from thence.8 And if the woman will not be willing to follow thee, then thou shalt be clear from this my oath: only bring not my son thither again.9 And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and sware to him concerning that matter.\r\n\r\n10 And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master, and departed; for all the goods of his master were in his hand: and he arose, and went to Mesopotamia, unto the city of Nahor.11 And he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a well of water at the time of the evening, even the time that women go out to draw water.12 And he said, O Lord God of my master Abraham, I pray thee, send me good speed this day, and shew kindness unto my master Abraham.13 Behold, I stand here by the well of water; and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water:14 And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed kindness unto my master.\r\n\r\n15 And it came to pass, before he had done speaking, that, behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel, son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother, with her pitcher upon her shoulder.16 And the damsel was very fair to look upon, a virgin, neither had any man known her: and she went down to the well, and filled her pitcher, and came up.17 And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Let me, I pray thee, drink a little water of thy pitcher.18 And she said, Drink, my lord: and she hasted, and let down her pitcher upon her hand, and gave him drink.19 And when she had done giving him drink, she said, I will draw water for thy camels also, until they have done drinking.20 And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again unto the well to draw water, and drew for all his camels.21 And the man wondering at her held his peace, to wit whether the Lord had made his journey prosperous or not.22 And it came to pass, as the camels had done drinking, that the man took a golden earring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold;23 And said, Whose daughter art thou? tell me, I pray thee: is there room in thy father's house for us to lodge in?24 And she said unto him, I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, which she bare unto Nahor.25 She said moreover unto him, We have both straw and provender enough, and room to lodge in.26 And the man bowed down his head, and worshipped the Lord.27 And he said, Blessed be the Lord God of my master Abraham, who hath not left destitute my master of his mercy and his truth: I being in the way, the Lord led me to the house of my master's brethren.28 And the damsel ran, and told them of her mother's house these things.\r\n\r\n29 And Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban: and Laban ran out unto the man, unto the well.30 And it came to pass, when he saw the earring and bracelets upon his sister's hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, Thus spake the man unto me; that he came unto the man; and, behold, he stood by the camels at the well.31 And he said, Come in, thou blessed of the Lord; wherefore standest thou without? for I have prepared the house, and room for the camels.\r\n\r\n32 And the man came into the house: and he ungirded his camels, and gave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash his feet, and the men's feet that were with him.33 And there was set meat before him to eat: but he said, I will not eat, until I have told mine errand. And he said, Speak on.34 And he said, I am Abraham's servant.35 And the Lord hath blessed my master greatly; and he is become great: and he hath given him flocks, and herds, and silver, and gold, and menservants, and maidservants, and camels, and asses.36 And Sarah my master's wife bare a son to my master when she was old: and unto him hath he given all that he hath.37 And my master made me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife to my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell:38 But thou shalt go unto my father's house, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son.39 And I said unto my master, Peradventure the woman will not follow me.40 And he said unto me, The Lord, before whom I walk, will send his angel with thee, and prosper thy way; and thou shalt take a wife for my son of my kindred, and of my father's house:41 Then shalt thou be clear from this my oath, when thou comest to my kindred; and if they give not thee one, thou shalt be clear from my oath.42 And I came this day unto the well, and said, O Lord God of my master Abraham, if now thou do prosper my way which I go:43 Behold, I stand by the well of water; and it shall come to pass, that when the virgin cometh forth to draw water, and I say to her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water of thy pitcher to drink;44 And she say to me, Both drink thou, and I will also draw for thy camels: let the same be the woman whom the Lord hath appointed out for my master's son.45 And before I had done speaking in mine heart, behold, Rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down unto the well, and drew water: and I said unto her, Let me drink, I pray thee.46 And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from her shoulder, and said, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: so I drank, and she made the camels drink also.47 And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter art thou? And she said, The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom Milcah bare unto him: and I put the earring upon her face, and the bracelets upon her hands.48 And I bowed down my head, and worshipped the Lord, and blessed the Lord God of my master Abraham, which had led me in the right way to take my master's brother's daughter unto his son.49 And now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me: and if not, tell me; that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left.50 Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceedeth from the Lord: we cannot speak unto thee bad or good.51 Behold, Rebekah is before thee, take her, and go, and let her be thy master's son's wife, as the Lord hath spoken.52 And it came to pass, that, when Abraham's servant heard their words, he worshipped the Lord, bowing himself to the earth.53 And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment, and gave them to Rebekah: he gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things.\r\n\r\n54 And they did eat and drink, he and the men that were with him, and tarried all night; and they rose up in the morning, and he said, Send me away unto my master.55 And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with us a few days, at the least ten; after that she shall go.56 And he said unto them, Hinder me not, seeing the Lord hath prospered my way; send me away that I may go to my master.57 And they said, We will call the damsel, and enquire at her mouth.58 And they called Rebekah, and said unto her, Wilt thou go with this man? And she said, I will go.59 And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham's servant, and his men.60 And they blessed Rebekah, and said unto her, Thou art our sister, be thou the mother of thousands of millions, and let thy seed possess the gate of those which hate them.\r\n\r\n61 And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels, and followed the man: and the servant took Rebekah, and went his way.\r\n\r\n62 And Isaac came from the way of the well Lahai\u2013roi; for he dwelt in the south country.63 And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide: and he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, the camels were coming.64 And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she lighted off the camel.65 For she had said unto the servant, What man is this that walketh in the field to meet us? And the servant had said, It is my master: therefore she took a vail, and covered herself.66 And the servant told Isaac all things that he had done.67 And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her: and Isaac was comforted after his mother's death.251 Then again Abraham took a wife, and her name was Keturah.2 And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah.3 And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim.4 And the sons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abida, and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah.\r\n\r\n5 And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac.6 But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country.7 And these are the days of the years of Abraham's life which he lived, an hundred threescore and fifteen years.8 Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people.9 And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is before Mamre;10 The field which Abraham purchased of the sons of Heth: there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife.\r\n\r\n11 And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed his son Isaac; and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahai\u2013roi.\r\n\r\n12 Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bare unto Abraham:13 And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebajoth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,14 And Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,15 Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah:16 These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to their nations.17 And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and was gathered unto his people.18 And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that is before Egypt, as thou goest toward Assyria: and he died in the presence of all his brethren.\r\n\r\n19 And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son: Abraham begat Isaac:20 And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padan\u2013aram, the sister to Laban the Syrian.21 And Isaac intreated the Lord for his wife, because she was barren: and the Lord was intreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.22 And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If it be so, why am I thus? And she went to enquire of the Lord.23 And the Lord said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb, and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels; and the one people shall be stronger than the other people; and the elder shall serve the younger.\r\n\r\n24 And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb.25 And the first came out red, all over like an hairy garment; and they called his name Esau.26 And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was threescore years old when she bare them.27 And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob was a plain man, dwelling in tents.28 And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison: but Rebekah loved Jacob.\r\n\r\n29 And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came from the field, and he was faint:30 And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red pottage; for I am faint: therefore was his name called Edom.31 And Jacob said, Sell me this day thy birthright.32 And Esau said, Behold, I am at the point to die: and what profit shall this birthright do to me?33 And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he sware unto him: and he sold his birthright unto Jacob.34 Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised his birthright.261 And there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went unto Abimelech king of the Philistines unto Gerar.2 And the Lord appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into Egypt; dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of:3 Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee; for unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give all these countries, and I will perform the oath which I sware unto Abraham thy father;4 And I will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven, and will give unto thy seed all these countries; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed;5 Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.\r\n\r\n6 And Isaac dwelt in Gerar:7 And the men of the place asked him of his wife; and he said, She is my sister: for he feared to say, She is my wife; lest, said he, the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah; because she was fair to look upon.8 And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife.9 And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, of a surety she is thy wife: and how saidst thou, She is my sister? And Isaac said unto him, Because I said, Lest I die for her.10 And Abimelech said, What is this thou hast done unto us? one of the people might lightly have lien with thy wife, and thou shouldest have brought guiltiness upon us.11 And Abimelech charged all his people, saying, He that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.\r\n\r\n12 Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year an hundredfold: and the Lord blessed him.13 And the man waxed great, and went forward, and grew until he became very great:14 For he had possession of flocks, and possession of herds, and great store of servants: and the Philistines envied him.15 For all the wells which his father's servants had digged in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped them, and filled them with earth.16 And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go from us; for thou art much mightier than we.\r\n\r\n17 And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt there.18 And Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they had digged in the days of Abraham his father; for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham: and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them.19 And Isaac's servants digged in the valley, and found there a well of springing water.20 And the herdmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac's herdmen, saying, The water is ours: and he called the name of the well Esek; because they strove with him.21 And they digged another well, and strove for that also: and he called the name of it Sitnah.22 And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for that they strove not: and he called the name of it Rehoboth; and he said, For now the Lord hath made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land.23 And he went up from thence to Beer\u2013sheba.24 And the Lord appeared unto him the same night, and said, I am the God of Abraham thy father: fear not, for I am with thee, and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham's sake.25 And he builded an altar there, and called upon the name of the Lord, and pitched his tent there: and there Isaac's servants digged a well.\r\n\r\n26 Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of his friends, and Phichol the chief captain of his army.27 And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore come ye to me, seeing ye hate me, and have sent me away from you?28 And they said, We saw certainly that the Lord was with thee: and we said, Let there be now an oath betwixt us, even betwixt us and thee, and let us make a covenant with thee;29 That thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and as we have done unto thee nothing but good, and have sent thee away in peace: thou art now the blessed of the Lord.30 And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink.31 And they rose up betimes in the morning, and sware one to another: and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace.32 And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac's servants came, and told him concerning the well which they had digged, and said unto him, We have found water.33 And he called it Shebah: therefore the name of the city is Beer\u2013sheba unto this day.\r\n\r\n34 And Esau was forty years old when he took to wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite:35 Which were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah.271 And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim, so that he could not see, he called Esau his eldest son, and said unto him, My son: and he said unto him, Behold, here am I.2 And he said, Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of my death:3 Now therefore take, I pray thee, thy weapons, thy quiver and thy bow, and go out to the field, and take me some venison;4 And make me savoury meat, such as I love, and bring it to me, that I may eat; that my soul may bless thee before I die.5 And Rebekah heard when Isaac spake to Esau his son. And Esau went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it.\r\n\r\n6 And Rebekah spake unto Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard thy father speak unto Esau thy brother, saying,7 Bring me venison, and make me savoury meat, that I may eat, and bless thee before the Lord before my death.8 Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I command thee.9 Go now to the flock, and fetch me from thence two good kids of the goats; and I will make them savoury meat for thy father, such as he loveth:10 And thou shalt bring it to thy father, that he may eat, and that he may bless thee before his death.11 And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man:12 My father peradventure will feel me, and I shall seem to him as a deceiver; and I shall bring a curse upon me, and not a blessing.13 And his mother said unto him, Upon me be thy curse, my son: only obey my voice, and go fetch me them.14 And he went, and fetched, and brought them to his mother: and his mother made savoury meat, such as his father loved.15 And Rebekah took goodly raiment of her eldest son Esau, which were with her in the house, and put them upon Jacob her younger son:16 And she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands, and upon the smooth of his neck:17 And she gave the savoury meat and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.\r\n\r\n18 And he came unto his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I; who art thou, my son?19 And Jacob said unto his father, I am Esau thy firstborn; I have done according as thou badest me: arise, I pray thee, sit and eat of my venison, that thy soul may bless me.20 And Isaac said unto his son, How is it that thou hast found it so quickly, my son? And he said, Because the Lord thy God brought it to me.21 And Isaac said unto Jacob, Come near, I pray thee, that I may feel thee, my son, whether thou be my very son Esau or not.22 And Jacob went near unto Isaac his father; and he felt him, and said, The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau.23 And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his brother Esau's hands: so he blessed him.24 And he said, Art thou my very son Esau? And he said, I am.25 And he said, Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son's venison, that my soul may bless thee. And he brought it near to him, and he did eat: and he brought him wine, and he drank.26 And his father Isaac said unto him, Come near now, and kiss me, my son.27 And he came near, and kissed him: and he smelled the smell of his raiment, and blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which the Lord hath blessed:28 Therefore God give thee of the dew of heaven, and the fatness of the earth, and plenty of corn and wine:29 Let people serve thee, and nations bow down to thee: be lord over thy brethren, and let thy mother's sons bow down to thee: cursed be every one that curseth thee, and blessed be he that blesseth thee.\r\n\r\n30 And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting.31 And he also had made savoury meat, and brought it unto his father, and said unto his father, Let my father arise, and eat of his son's venison, that thy soul may bless me.32 And Isaac his father said unto him, Who art thou? And he said, I am thy son, thy firstborn Esau.33 And Isaac trembled very exceedingly, and said, Who? where is he that hath taken venison, and brought it me, and I have eaten of all before thou camest, and have blessed him? yea, and he shall be blessed.34 And when Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with a great and exceeding bitter cry, and said unto his father, Bless me, even me also, O my father.35 And he said, Thy brother came with subtilty, and hath taken away thy blessing.36 And he said, Is not he rightly named Jacob? for he hath supplanted me these two times: he took away my birthright; and, behold, now he hath taken away my blessing. And he said, Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me?37 And Isaac answered and said unto Esau, Behold, I have made him thy lord, and all his brethren have I given to him for servants; and with corn and wine have I sustained him: and what shall I do now unto thee, my son?38 And Esau said unto his father, Hast thou but one blessing, my father? bless me, even me also, O my father. And Esau lifted up his voice, and wept.39 And Isaac his father answered and said unto him, Behold, thy dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of heaven from above;40 And by thy sword shalt thou live, and shalt serve thy brother; and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion, that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck.\r\n\r\n41 And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing wherewith his father blessed him: and Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning for my father are at hand; then will I slay my brother Jacob.42 And these words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah: and she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said unto him, Behold, thy brother Esau, as touching thee, doth comfort himself, purposing to kill thee.43 Now therefore, my son, obey my voice; and arise, flee thou to Laban my brother to Haran;44 And tarry with him a few days, until thy brother's fury turn away;45 Until thy brother's anger turn away from thee, and he forget that which thou hast done to him: then I will send, and fetch thee from thence: why should I be deprived also of you both in one day?46 And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth: if Jacob take a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these which are of the daughters of the land, what good shall my life do me?281 And Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him, and charged him, and said unto him, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan.2 Arise, go to Padan\u2013aram, to the house of Bethuel thy mother's father; and take thee a wife from thence of the daughters of Laban thy mother's brother.3 And God Almighty bless thee, and make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, that thou mayest be a multitude of people;4 And give thee the blessing of Abraham, to thee, and to thy seed with thee; that thou mayest inherit the land wherein thou art a stranger, which God gave unto Abraham.5 And Isaac sent away Jacob: and he went to Padan\u2013aram unto Laban, son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob's and Esau's mother.\r\n\r\n6 When Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob, and sent him away to Padan\u2013aram, to take him a wife from thence; and that as he blessed him he gave him a charge, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan;7 And that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother, and was gone to Padan\u2013aram;8 And Esau seeing that the daughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac his father;9 Then went Esau unto Ishmael, and took unto the wives which he had Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael Abraham's son, the sister of Nebajoth, to be his wife.\r\n\r\n10 And Jacob went out from Beer\u2013sheba, and went toward Haran.11 And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all night, because the sun was set; and he took of the stones of that place, and put them for his pillows, and lay down in that place to sleep.12 And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it.13 And, behold, the Lord stood above it, and said, I am the Lord God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac: the land whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed;14 And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and thou shalt spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south: and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.15 And, behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land; for I will not leave thee, until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of.\r\n\r\n16 And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the Lord is in this place; and I knew it not.17 And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place! this is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.18 And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put for his pillows, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil upon the top of it.19 And he called the name of that place Beth\u2013el: but the name of that city was called Luz at the first.20 And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on,21 So that I come again to my father's house in peace; then shall the Lord be my God:22 And this stone, which I have set for a pillar, shall be God's house: and of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee.291 Then Jacob went on his journey, and came into the land of the people of the east.2 And he looked, and behold a well in the field, and, lo, there were three flocks of sheep lying by it; for out of that well they watered the flocks: and a great stone was upon the well's mouth.3 And thither were all the flocks gathered: and they rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone again upon the well's mouth in his place.4 And Jacob said unto them, My brethren, whence be ye? And they said, Of Haran are we.5 And he said unto them, Know ye Laban the son of Nahor? And they said, We know him.6 And he said unto them, Is he well? And they said, He is well: and, behold, Rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep.7 And he said, Lo, it is yet high day, neither is it time that the cattle should be gathered together: water ye the sheep, and go and feed them.8 And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks be gathered together, and till they roll the stone from the well's mouth; then we water the sheep.\r\n\r\n9 And while he yet spake with them, Rachel came with her father's sheep: for she kept them.10 And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother's brother, that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother's brother.11 And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept.12 And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's brother, and that he was Rebekah's son: and she ran and told her father.13 And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sister's son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban all these things.14 And Laban said to him, Surely thou art my bone and my flesh. And he abode with him the space of a month.\r\n\r\n15 And Laban said unto Jacob, Because thou art my brother, shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought? tell me, what shall thy wages be?16 And Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.17 Leah was tender eyed; but Rachel was beautiful and well favoured.18 And Jacob loved Rachel; and said, I will serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter.19 And Laban said, It is better that I give her to thee, than that I should give her to another man: abide with me.20 And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed unto him but a few days, for the love he had to her.\r\n\r\n21 And Jacob said unto Laban, Give me my wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I may go in unto her.22 And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast.23 And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to him; and he went in unto her.24 And Laban gave unto his daughter Leah Zilpah his maid for an handmaid.25 And it came to pass, that in the morning, behold, it was Leah: and he said to Laban, What is this thou hast done unto me? did not I serve with thee for Rachel? wherefore then hast thou beguiled me?26 And Laban said, It must not be so done in our country, to give the younger before the firstborn.27 Fulfil her week, and we will give thee this also for the service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years.28 And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week: and he gave him Rachel his daughter to wife also.29 And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to be her maid.30 And he went in also unto Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah, and served with him yet seven other years.\r\n\r\n31 And when the Lord saw that Leah was hated, he opened her womb: but Rachel was barren.32 And Leah conceived, and bare a son, and she called his name Reuben: for she said, Surely the Lord hath looked upon my affliction; now therefore my husband will love me.33 And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Because the Lord hath heard that I was hated, he hath therefore given me this son also: and she called his name Simeon.34 And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Now this time will my husband be joined unto me, because I have born him three sons: therefore was his name called Levi.35 And she conceived again, and bare a son: and she said, Now will I praise the Lord: therefore she called his name Judah; and left bearing.301 And when Rachel saw that she bare Jacob no children, Rachel envied her sister; and said unto Jacob, Give me children, or else I die.2 And Jacob's anger was kindled against Rachel: and he said, Am I in God's stead, who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb?3 And she said, Behold my maid Bilhah, go in unto her; and she shall bear upon my knees, that I may also have children by her.4 And she gave him Bilhah her handmaid to wife: and Jacob went in unto her.5 And Bilhah conceived, and bare Jacob a son.6 And Rachel said, God hath judged me, and hath also heard my voice, and hath given me a son: therefore called she his name Dan.7 And Bilhah Rachel's maid conceived again, and bare Jacob a second son.8 And Rachel said, With great wrestlings have I wrestled with my sister, and I have prevailed: and she called his name Naphtali.9 When Leah saw that she had left bearing, she took Zilpah her maid, and gave her Jacob to wife.10 And Zilpah Leah's maid bare Jacob a son.11 And Leah said, A troop cometh: and she called his name Gad.12 And Zilpah Leah's maid bare Jacob a second son.13 And Leah said, Happy am I, for the daughters will call me blessed: and she called his name Asher.\r\n\r\n14 And Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them unto his mother Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, Give me, I pray thee, of thy son's mandrakes.15 And she said unto her, Is it a small matter that thou hast taken my husband? and wouldest thou take away my son's mandrakes also? And Rachel said, Therefore he shall lie with thee to night for thy son's mandrakes.16 And Jacob came out of the field in the evening, and Leah went out to meet him, and said, Thou must come in unto me; for surely I have hired thee with my son's mandrakes. And he lay with her that night.17 And God hearkened unto Leah, and she conceived, and bare Jacob the fifth son.18 And Leah said, God hath given me my hire, because I have given my maiden to my husband: and she called his name Issachar.19 And Leah conceived again, and bare Jacob the sixth son.20 And Leah said, God hath endued me with a good dowry; now will my husband dwell with me, because I have born him six sons: and she called his name Zebulun.21 And afterwards she bare a daughter, and called her name Dinah.\r\n\r\n22 And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her, and opened her womb.23 And she conceived, and bare a son; and said, God hath taken away my reproach:24 And she called his name Joseph; and said, The Lord shall add to me another son.\r\n\r\n25 And it came to pass, when Rachel had born Joseph, that Jacob said unto Laban, Send me away, that I may go unto mine own place, and to my country.26 Give me my wives and my children, for whom I have served thee, and let me go: for thou knowest my service which I have done thee.27 And Laban said unto him, I pray thee, if I have found favour in thine eyes, tarry: for I have learned by experience that the Lord hath blessed me for thy sake.28 And he said, Appoint me thy wages, and I will give it.29 And he said unto him, Thou knowest how I have served thee, and how thy cattle was with me.30 For it was little which thou hadst before I came, and it is now increased unto a multitude; and the Lord hath blessed thee since my coming: and now when shall I provide for mine own house also?31 And he said, What shall I give thee? And Jacob said, Thou shalt not give me any thing: if thou wilt do this thing for me, I will again feed and keep thy flock:32 I will pass through all thy flock to day, removing from thence all the speckled and spotted cattle, and all the brown cattle among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats: and of such shall be my hire.33 So shall my righteousness answer for me in time to come, when it shall come for my hire before thy face: every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats, and brown among the sheep, that shall be counted stolen with me.34 And Laban said, Behold, I would it might be according to thy word.35 And he removed that day the he goats that were ringstraked and spotted, and all the she goats that were speckled and spotted, and every one that had some white in it, and all the brown among the sheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons.36 And he set three days' journey betwixt himself and Jacob: and Jacob fed the rest of Laban's flocks.\r\n\r\n37 And Jacob took him rods of green poplar, and of the hazel and chesnut tree; and pilled white strakes in them, and made the white appear which was in the rods.38 And he set the rods which he had pilled before the flocks in the gutters in the watering troughs when the flocks came to drink, that they should conceive when they came to drink.39 And the flocks conceived before the rods, and brought forth cattle ringstraked, speckled, and spotted.40 And Jacob did separate the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks toward the ringstraked, and all the brown in the flock of Laban; and he put his own flocks by themselves, and put them not unto Laban's cattle.41 And it came to pass, whensoever the stronger cattle did conceive, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the cattle in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods.42 But when the cattle were feeble, he put them not in: so the feebler were Laban's, and the stronger Jacob's.43 And the man increased exceedingly, and had much cattle, and maidservants, and menservants, and camels, and asses.311 And he heard the words of Laban's sons, saying, Jacob hath taken away all that was our father's; and of that which was our father's hath he gotten all this glory.2 And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and, behold, it was not toward him as before.3 And the Lord said unto Jacob, Return unto the land of thy fathers, and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee.4 And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto his flock,5 And said unto them, I see your father's countenance, that it is not toward me as before; but the God of my father hath been with me.6 And ye know that with all my power I have served your father.7 And your father hath deceived me, and changed my wages ten times; but God suffered him not to hurt me.8 If he said thus, The speckled shall be thy wages; then all the cattle bare speckled: and if he said thus, The ringstraked shall be thy hire; then bare all the cattle ringstraked.9 Thus God hath taken away the cattle of your father, and given them to me.10 And it came to pass at the time that the cattle conceived, that I lifted up mine eyes, and saw in a dream, and, behold, the rams which leaped upon the cattle were ringstraked, speckled, and grisled.11 And the angel of God spake unto me in a dream, saying, Jacob: And I said, Here am I.12 And he said, Lift up now thine eyes, and see, all the rams which leap upon the cattle are ringstraked, speckled, and grisled: for I have seen all that Laban doeth unto thee.13 I am the God of Beth\u2013el, where thou anointedst the pillar, and where thou vowedst a vow unto me: now arise, get thee out from this land, and return unto the land of thy kindred.14 And Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him, Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father's house?15 Are we not counted of him strangers? for he hath sold us, and hath quite devoured also our money.16 For all the riches which God hath taken from our father, that is ours, and our children's: now then, whatsoever God hath said unto thee, do.\r\n\r\n17 Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon camels;18 And he carried away all his cattle, and all his goods which he had gotten, the cattle of his getting, which he had gotten in Padan\u2013aram, for to go to Isaac his father in the land of Canaan.19 And Laban went to shear his sheep: and Rachel had stolen the images that were her father's.20 And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that he told him not that he fled.21 So he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed over the river, and set his face toward the mount Gilead.22 And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob was fled.23 And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven days' journey; and they overtook him in the mount Gilead.24 And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream by night, and said unto him, Take heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.\r\n\r\n25 Then Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mount: and Laban with his brethren pitched in the mount of Gilead.26 And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast stolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters, as captives taken with the sword?27 Wherefore didst thou flee away secretly, and steal away from me; and didst not tell me, that I might have sent thee away with mirth, and with songs, with tabret, and with harp?28 And hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters? thou hast now done foolishly in so doing.29 It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of your father spake unto me yesternight, saying, Take thou heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.30 And now, though thou wouldest needs be gone, because thou sore longedst after thy father's house, yet wherefore hast thou stolen my gods?31 And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid: for I said, Peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy daughters from me.32 With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, let him not live: before our brethren discern thou what is thine with me, and take it to thee. For Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them.33 And Laban went into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent, and into the two maidservants' tents; but he found them not. Then went he out of Leah's tent, and entered into Rachel's tent.34 Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the camel's furniture, and sat upon them. And Laban searched all the tent, but found them not.35 And she said to her father, Let it not displease my lord that I cannot rise up before thee; for the custom of women is upon me. And he searched, but found not the images.\r\n\r\n36 And Jacob was wroth, and chode with Laban: and Jacob answered and said to Laban, What is my trespass? what is my sin, that thou hast so hotly pursued after me?37 Whereas thou hast searched all my stuff, what hast thou found of all thy household stuff? set it here before my brethren and thy brethren, that they may judge betwixt us both.38 This twenty years have I been with thee; thy ewes and thy she goats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flock have I not eaten.39 That which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thee; I bare the loss of it; of my hand didst thou require it, whether stolen by day, or stolen by night.40 Thus I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep departed from mine eyes.41 Thus have I been twenty years in thy house; I served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy cattle: and thou hast changed my wages ten times.42 Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely thou hadst sent me away now empty. God hath seen mine affliction and the labour of my hands, and rebuked thee yesternight.\r\n\r\n43 And Laban answered and said unto Jacob, These daughters are my daughters, and these children are my children, and these cattle are my cattle, and all that thou seest is mine: and what can I do this day unto these my daughters, or unto their children which they have born?44 Now therefore come thou, let us make a covenant, I and thou; and let it be for a witness between me and thee.45 And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar.46 And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they took stones, and made an heap: and they did eat there upon the heap.47 And Laban called it Jegar\u2013sahadutha: but Jacob called it Galeed.48 And Laban said, This heap is a witness between me and thee this day. Therefore was the name of it called Galeed;49 And Mizpah; for he said, The Lord watch between me and thee, when we are absent one from another.50 If thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt take other wives beside my daughters, no man is with us; see, God is witness betwixt me and thee.51 And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold this pillar, which I have cast betwixt me and thee;52 This heap be witness, and this pillar be witness, that I will not pass over this heap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this pillar unto me, for harm.53 The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge betwixt us. And Jacob sware by the fear of his father Isaac.54 Then Jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount, and called his brethren to eat bread: and they did eat bread, and tarried all night in the mount.55 And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them: and Laban departed, and returned unto his place.321 And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.2 And when Jacob saw them, he said, This is God's host: and he called the name of that place Mahanaim.\r\n\r\n3 And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land of Seir, the country of Edom.4 And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak unto my lord Esau; Thy servant Jacob saith thus, I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed there until now:5 And I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and menservants, and womenservants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find grace in thy sight.\r\n\r\n6 And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother Esau, and also he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men with him.7 Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed: and he divided the people that was with him, and the flocks, and herds, and the camels, into two bands;8 And said, If Esau come to the one company, and smite it, then the other company which is left shall escape.\r\n\r\n9 And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, the Lord which saidst unto me, Return unto thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will deal well with thee:10 I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which thou hast shewed unto thy servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two bands.11 Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he will come and smite me, and the mother with the children.12 And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.\r\n\r\n13 And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which came to his hand a present for Esau his brother;14 Two hundred she goats, and twenty he goats, two hundred ewes, and twenty rams,15 Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty kine, and ten bulls, twenty she asses, and ten foals.16 And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove by themselves; and said unto his servants, Pass over before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove.17 And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose art thou? and whither goest thou? and whose are these before thee?18 Then thou shalt say, They be thy servant Jacob's; it is a present sent unto my lord Esau: and, behold, also he is behind us.19 And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau, when ye find him.20 And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept of me.21 So went the present over before him: and himself lodged that night in the company.22 And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two womenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford Jabbok.23 And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over that he had.\r\n\r\n24 And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day.25 And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint, as he wrestled with him.26 And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I will not let thee go, except thou bless me.27 And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob.28 And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast prevailed.29 And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name. And he said, Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name? And he blessed him there.30 And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.31 And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he halted upon his thigh.32 Therefore the children of Israel eat not of the sinew which shrank, which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day: because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the sinew that shrank.331 And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau came, and with him four hundred men. And he divided the children unto Leah, and unto Rachel, and unto the two handmaids.2 And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph hindermost.3 And he passed over before them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother.4 And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him: and they wept.\r\n\r\n5 And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children; and said, Who are those with thee? And he said, The children which God hath graciously given thy servant.6 Then the handmaidens came near, they and their children, and they bowed themselves.7 And Leah also with her children came near, and bowed themselves: and after came Joseph near and Rachel, and they bowed themselves.8 And he said, What meanest thou by all this drove which I met? And he said, These are to find grace in the sight of my lord.9 And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; keep that thou hast unto thyself.10 And Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found grace in thy sight, then receive my present at my hand: for therefore I have seen thy face, as though I had seen the face of God, and thou wast pleased with me.11 Take, I pray thee, my blessing that is brought to thee; because God hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough. And he urged him, and he took it.12 And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go before thee.13 And he said unto him, My lord knoweth that the children are tender, and the flocks and herds with young are with me: and if men should overdrive them one day, all the flock will die.14 Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant: and I will lead on softly, according as the cattle that goeth before me and the children be able to endure, until I come unto my lord unto Seir.15 And Esau said, Let me now leave with thee some of the folk that are with me. And he said, What needeth it? let me find grace in the sight of my lord.\r\n\r\n16 So Esau returned that day on his way unto Seir.17 And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him an house, and made booths for his cattle: therefore the name of the place is called Succoth.\r\n\r\n18 And Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Padan\u2013aram; and pitched his tent before the city.19 And he bought a parcel of a field, where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem's father, for an hundred pieces of money.20 And he erected there an altar, and called it El\u2013elohe\u2013Israel.341 And Dinah the daughter of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob, went out to see the daughters of the land.2 And when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, prince of the country, saw her, he took her, and lay with her, and defiled her.3 And his soul clave unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the damsel, and spake kindly unto the damsel.4 And Shechem spake unto his father Hamor, saying, Get me this damsel to wife.5 And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter: now his sons were with his cattle in the field: and Jacob held his peace until they were come.\r\n\r\n6 And Hamor the father of Shechem went out unto Jacob to commune with him.7 And the sons of Jacob came out of the field when they heard it: and the men were grieved, and they were very wroth, because he had wrought folly in Israel in lying with Jacob's daughter; which thing ought not to be done.8 And Hamor communed with them, saying, The soul of my son Shechem longeth for your daughter: I pray you give her him to wife.9 And make ye marriages with us, and give your daughters unto us, and take our daughters unto you.10 And ye shall dwell with us: and the land shall be before you; dwell and trade ye therein, and get you possessions therein.11 And Shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren, Let me find grace in your eyes, and what ye shall say unto me I will give.12 Ask me never so much dowry and gift, and I will give according as ye shall say unto me: but give me the damsel to wife.13 And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father deceitfully, and said, because he had defiled Dinah their sister:14 And they said unto them, We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised; for that were a reproach unto us:15 But in this will we consent unto you: If ye will be as we be, that every male of you be circumcised;16 Then will we give our daughters unto you, and we will take your daughters to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will become one people.17 But if ye will not hearken unto us, to be circumcised; then will we take our daughter, and we will be gone.\r\n\r\n18 And their words pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamor's son.19 And the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he had delight in Jacob's daughter: and he was more honourable than all the house of his father.\r\n\r\n20 And Hamor and Shechem his son came unto the gate of their city, and communed with the men of their city, saying,21 These men are peaceable with us; therefore let them dwell in the land, and trade therein; for the land, behold, it is large enough for them; let us take their daughters to us for wives, and let us give them our daughters.22 Only herein will the men consent unto us for to dwell with us, to be one people, if every male among us be circumcised, as they are circumcised.23 Shall not their cattle and their substance and every beast of theirs be ours? only let us consent unto them, and they will dwell with us.24 And unto Hamor and unto Shechem his son hearkened all that went out of the gate of his city; and every male was circumcised, all that went out of the gate of his city.\r\n\r\n25 And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore, that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brethren, took each man his sword, and came upon the city boldly, and slew all the males.26 And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem's house, and went out.27 The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and spoiled the city, because they had defiled their sister.28 They took their sheep, and their oxen, and their asses, and that which was in the city, and that which was in the field,29 And all their wealth, and all their little ones, and their wives took they captive, and spoiled even all that was in the house.30 And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me to make me to stink among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites: and I being few in number, they shall gather themselves together against me, and slay me; and I shall be destroyed, I and my house.31 And they said, Should he deal with our sister as with an harlot?351 And God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to Beth\u2013el, and dwell there: and make there an altar unto God, that appeared unto thee when thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother.2 Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that were with him, Put away the strange gods that are among you, and be clean, and change your garments:3 And let us arise, and go up to Beth\u2013el; and I will make there an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went.4 And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which were in their hand, and all their earrings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem.5 And they journeyed: and the terror of God was upon the cities that were round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob.\r\n\r\n6 So Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan, that is, Beth\u2013el, he and all the people that were with him.7 And he built there an altar, and called the place El\u2013beth\u2013el: because there God appeared unto him, when he fled from the face of his brother.8 But Deborah Rebekah's nurse died, and she was buried beneath Beth\u2013el under an oak: and the name of it was called Allon\u2013bachuth.\r\n\r\n9 And God appeared unto Jacob again, when he came out of Padan\u2013aram, and blessed him.10 And God said unto him, Thy name is Jacob: thy name shall not be called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name: and he called his name Israel.11 And God said unto him, I am God Almighty: be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee, and kings shall come out of thy loins;12 And the land which I gave Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will give it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land.13 And God went up from him in the place where he talked with him.14 And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with him, even a pillar of stone: and he poured a drink offering thereon, and he poured oil thereon.15 And Jacob called the name of the place where God spake with him, Beth\u2013el.\r\n\r\n16 And they journeyed from Beth\u2013el; and there was but a little way to come to Ephrath: and Rachel travailed, and she had hard labour.17 And it came to pass, when she was in hard labour, that the midwife said unto her, Fear not; thou shalt have this son also.18 And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing, (for she died) that she called his name Ben\u2013oni: but his father called him Benjamin.19 And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath, which is Beth\u2013lehem.20 And Jacob set a pillar upon her grave: that is the pillar of Rachel's grave unto this day.\r\n\r\n21 And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Edar.22 And it came to pass, when Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine: and Israel heard it. Now the sons of Jacob were twelve:23 The sons of Leah; Reuben, Jacob's firstborn, and Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun:24 The sons of Rachel; Joseph, and Benjamin:25 And the sons of Bilhah, Rachel's handmaid; Dan, and Naphtali:26 And the sons of Zilpah, Leah's handmaid; Gad, and Asher: these are the sons of Jacob, which were born to him in Padan\u2013aram.\r\n\r\n27 And Jacob came unto Isaac his father unto Mamre, unto the city of Arbah, which is Hebron, where Abraham and Isaac sojourned.28 And the days of Isaac were an hundred and fourscore years.29 And Isaac gave up the ghost, and died, and was gathered unto his people, being old and full of days: and his sons Esau and Jacob buried him.361 Now these are the generations of Esau, who is Edom.2 Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan; Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite;3 And Bashemath Ishmael's daughter, sister of Nebajoth.4 And Adah bare to Esau Eliphaz; and Bashemath bare Reuel;5 And Aholibamah bare Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah: these are the sons of Esau, which were born unto him in the land of Canaan.6 And Esau took his wives, and his sons, and his daughters, and all the persons of his house, and his cattle, and all his beasts, and all his substance, which he had got in the land of Canaan; and went into the country from the face of his brother Jacob.7 For their riches were more than that they might dwell together; and the land wherein they were strangers could not bear them because of their cattle.8 Thus dwelt Esau in mount Seir: Esau is Edom.\r\n\r\n9 And these are the generations of Esau the father of the Edomites in mount Seir:10 These are the names of Esau's sons; Eliphaz the son of Adah the wife of Esau, Reuel the son of Bashemath the wife of Esau.11 And the sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, and Gatam, and Kenaz.12 And Timna was concubine to Eliphaz Esau's son; and she bare to Eliphaz Amalek: these were the sons of Adah Esau's wife.13 And these are the sons of Reuel; Nahath, and Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah: these were the sons of Bashemath Esau's wife.\r\n\r\n14 And these were the sons of Aholibamah, the daughter of Anah the daughter of Zibeon, Esau's wife: and she bare to Esau Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah.\r\n\r\n15 These were dukes of the sons of Esau: the sons of Eliphaz the firstborn son of Esau; duke Teman, duke Omar, duke Zepho, duke Kenaz,16 Duke Korah, duke Gatam, and duke Amalek: these are the dukes that came of Eliphaz in the land of Edom; these were the sons of Adah.\r\n\r\n17 And these are the sons of Reuel Esau's son; duke Nahath, duke Zerah, duke Shammah, duke Mizzah: these are the dukes that came of Reuel in the land of Edom; these are the sons of Bashemath Esau's wife.\r\n\r\n18 And these are the sons of Aholibamah Esau's wife; duke Jeush, duke Jaalam, duke Korah: these were the dukes that came of Aholibamah the daughter of Anah, Esau's wife.19 These are the sons of Esau, who is Edom, and these are their dukes.\r\n\r\n20 These are the sons of Seir the Horite, who inhabited the land; Lotan, and Shobal, and Zibeon, and Anah,21 And Dishon, and Ezer, and Dishan: these are the dukes of the Horites, the children of Seir in the land of Edom.22 And the children of Lotan were Hori and Hemam; and Lotan's sister was Timna.23 And the children of Shobal were these; Alvan, and Manahath, and Ebal, Shepho, and Onam.24 And these are the children of Zibeon; both Ajah, and Anah: this was that Anah that found the mules in the wilderness, as he fed the asses of Zibeon his father.25 And the children of Anah were these; Dishon, and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah.26 And these are the children of Dishon; Hemdan, and Eshban, and Ithran, and Cheran.27 The children of Ezer are these; Bilhan, and Zaavan, and Akan.28 The children of Dishan are these; Uz, and Aran.29 These are the dukes that came of the Horites; duke Lotan, duke Shobal, duke Zibeon, duke Anah,30 Duke Dishon, duke Ezer, duke Dishan: these are the dukes that came of Hori, among their dukes in the land of Seir.\r\n\r\n31 And these are the kings that reigned in the land of Edom, before there reigned any king over the children of Israel.32 And Bela the son of Beor reigned in Edom: and the name of his city was Dinhabah.33 And Bela died, and Jobab the son of Zerah of Bozrah reigned in his stead.34 And Jobab died, and Husham of the land of Temani reigned in his stead.35 And Husham died, and Hadad the son of Bedad, who smote Midian in the field of Moab, reigned in his stead: and the name of his city was Avith.36 And Hadad died, and Samlah of Masrekah reigned in his stead.37 And Samlah died, and Saul of Rehoboth by the river reigned in his stead.38 And Saul died, and Baal\u2013hanan the son of Achbor reigned in his stead.39 And Baal\u2013hanan the son of Achbor died, and Hadar reigned in his stead: and the name of his city was Pau; and his wife's name was Mehetabel, the daughter of Matred, the daughter of Mezahab.40 And these are the names of the dukes that came of Esau, according to their families, after their places, by their names; duke Timnah, duke Alvah, duke Jetheth,41 Duke Aholibamah, duke Elah, duke Pinon,42 Duke Kenaz, duke Teman, duke Mibzar,43 Duke Magdiel, duke Iram: these be the dukes of Edom, according to their habitations in the land of their possession: he is Esau the father of the Edomites.371 And Jacob dwelt in the land wherein his father was a stranger, in the land of Canaan.2 These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen years old, was feeding the flock with his brethren; and the lad was with the sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah, his father's wives: and Joseph brought unto his father their evil report.3 Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son of his old age: and he made him a coat of many colours.4 And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably unto him.\r\n\r\n5 And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it his brethren: and they hated him yet the more.6 And he said unto them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have dreamed:7 For, behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and, lo, my sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and, behold, your sheaves stood round about, and made obeisance to my sheaf.8 And his brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us? or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us? And they hated him yet the more for his dreams, and for his words.\r\n\r\n9 And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it his brethren, and said, Behold, I have dreamed a dream more; and, behold, the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me.10 And he told it to his father, and to his brethren: and his father rebuked him, and said unto him, What is this dream that thou hast dreamed? Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth?11 And his brethren envied him; but his father observed the saying.\r\n\r\n12 And his brethren went to feed their father's flock in Shechem.13 And Israel said unto Joseph, Do not thy brethren feed the flock in Shechem? come, and I will send thee unto them. And he said to him, Here am I.14 And he said to him, Go, I pray thee, see whether it be well with thy brethren, and well with the flocks; and bring me word again. So he sent him out of the vale of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.\r\n\r\n15 And a certain man found him, and, behold, he was wandering in the field: and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou?16 And he said, I seek my brethren: tell me, I pray thee, where they feed their flocks.17 And the man said, They are departed hence; for I heard them say, Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brethren, and found them in Dothan.18 And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near unto them, they conspired against him to slay him.19 And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer cometh.20 Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into some pit, and we will say, Some evil beast hath devoured him: and we shall see what will become of his dreams.21 And Reuben heard it, and he delivered him out of their hands; and said, Let us not kill him.22 And Reuben said unto them, Shed no blood, but cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness, and lay no hand upon him; that he might rid him out of their hands, to deliver him to his father again.\r\n\r\n23 And it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his brethren, that they stript Joseph out of his coat, his coat of many colours that was on him;24 And they took him, and cast him into a pit: and the pit was empty, there was no water in it.25 And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and, behold, a company of Ishmeelites came from Gilead with their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh, going to carry it down to Egypt.26 And Judah said unto his brethren, What profit is it if we slay our brother, and conceal his blood?27 Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmeelites, and let not our hand be upon him; for he is our brother and our flesh. And his brethren were content.28 Then there passed by Midianites merchantmen; and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmeelites for twenty pieces of silver: and they brought Joseph into Egypt.\r\n\r\n29 And Reuben returned unto the pit; and, behold, Joseph was not in the pit; and he rent his clothes.30 And he returned unto his brethren, and said, The child is not; and I, whither shall I go?\r\n\r\n31 And they took Joseph's coat, and killed a kid of the goats, and dipped the coat in the blood;32 And they sent the coat of many colours, and they brought it to their father; and said, This have we found: know now whether it be thy son's coat or no.33 And he knew it, and said, It is my son's coat; an evil beast hath devoured him; Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces.34 And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and mourned for his son many days.35 And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go down into the grave unto my son mourning. Thus his father wept for him.36 And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh's, and captain of the guard.381 And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from his brethren, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah.2 And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose name was Shuah; and he took her, and went in unto her.3 And she conceived, and bare a son; and he called his name Er.4 And she conceived again, and bare a son; and she called his name Onan.5 And she yet again conceived, and bare a son; and called his name Shelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bare him.6 And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, whose name was Tamar.7 And Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the Lord; and the Lord slew him.8 And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brother's wife, and marry her, and raise up seed to thy brother.9 And Onan knew that the seed should not be his; and it came to pass, when he went in unto his brother's wife, that he spilled it on the ground, lest that he should give seed to his brother.10 And the thing which he did displeased the Lord: wherefore he slew him also.11 Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter in law, Remain a widow at thy father's house, till Shelah my son be grown: for he said, Lest peradventure he die also, as his brethren did. And Tamar went and dwelt in her father's house.\r\n\r\n12 And in process of time the daughter of Shuah Judah's wife died; and Judah was comforted, and went up unto his sheepshearers to Timnath, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite.13 And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold thy father in law goeth up to Timnath to shear his sheep.14 And she put her widow's garments off from her, and covered her with a vail, and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place, which is by the way to Timnath; for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she was not given unto him to wife.15 When Judah saw her, he thought her to be an harlot; because she had covered her face.16 And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Go to, I pray thee, let me come in unto thee; (for he knew not that she was his daughter in law.) And she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayest come in unto me?17 And he said, I will send thee a kid from the flock. And she said, Wilt thou give me a pledge, till thou send it?18 And he said, What pledge shall I give thee? And she said, Thy signet, and thy bracelets, and thy staff that is in thine hand. And he gave it her, and came in unto her, and she conceived by him.19 And she arose, and went away, and laid by her vail from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood.20 And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive his pledge from the woman's hand: but he found her not.21 Then he asked the men of that place, saying, Where is the harlot, that was openly by the way side? And they said, There was no harlot in this place.22 And he returned to Judah, and said, I cannot find her; and also the men of the place said, that there was no harlot in this place.23 And Judah said, Let her take it to her, lest we be shamed: behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her.\r\n\r\n24 And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot; and also, behold, she is with child by whoredom. And Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt.25 When she was brought forth, she sent to her father in law, saying, By the man, whose these are, am I with child: and she said, Discern, I pray thee, whose are these, the signet, and bracelets, and staff.26 And Judah acknowledged them, and said, She hath been more righteous than I; because that I gave her not to Shelah my son. And he knew her again no more.\r\n\r\n27 And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold, twins were in her womb.28 And it came to pass, when she travailed, that the one put out his hand: and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread, saying, This came out first.29 And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold, his brother came out: and she said, How hast thou broken forth? this breach be upon thee: therefore his name was called Pharez.30 And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet thread upon his hand: and his name was called Zarah.391 And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the hands of the Ishmeelites, which had brought him down thither.2 And the Lord was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian.3 And his master saw that the Lord was with him, and that the Lord made all that he did to prosper in his hand.4 And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him: and he made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand.5 And it came to pass from the time that he had made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that the Lord blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake; and the blessing of the Lord was upon all that he had in the house, and in the field.6 And he left all that he had in Joseph's hand; and he knew not ought he had, save the bread which he did eat. And Joseph was a goodly person, and well favoured.\r\n\r\n7 And it came to pass after these things, that his master's wife cast her eyes upon Joseph; and she said, Lie with me.8 But he refused, and said unto his master's wife, Behold, my master wotteth not what is with me in the house, and he hath committed all that he hath to my hand;9 There is none greater in this house than I; neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee, because thou art his wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?10 And it came to pass, as she spake to Joseph day by day, that he hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, or to be with her.11 And it came to pass about this time, that Joseph went into the house to do his business; and there was none of the men of the house there within.12 And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out.\r\n\r\n13 And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and was fled forth,14 That she called unto the men of her house, and spake unto them, saying, See, he hath brought in an Hebrew unto us to mock us; he came in unto me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice:15 And it came to pass, when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled, and got him out.16 And she laid up his garment by her, until his lord came home.17 And she spake unto him according to these words, saying, The Hebrew servant, which thou hast brought unto us, came in unto me to mock me:18 And it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled out.\r\n\r\n19 And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his wife, which she spake unto him, saying, After this manner did thy servant to me; that his wrath was kindled.20 And Joseph's master took him, and put him into the prison, a place where the king's prisoners were bound: and he was there in the prison.\r\n\r\n21 But the Lord was with Joseph, and shewed him mercy, and gave him favour in the sight of the keeper of the prison.22 And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's hand all the prisoners that were in the prison; and whatsoever they did there, he was the doer of it.23 The keeper of the prison looked not to any thing that was under his hand; because the Lord was with him, and that which he did, the Lord made it to prosper.401 And it came to pass after these things, that the butler of the king of Egypt and his baker had offended their lord the king of Egypt.2 And Pharaoh was wroth against two of his officers, against the chief of the butlers, and against the chief of the bakers.3 And he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard, into the prison, the place where Joseph was bound.4 And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he served them: and they continued a season in ward.\r\n\r\n5 And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream in one night, each man according to the interpretation of his dream, the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, which were bound in the prison.6 And Joseph came in unto them in the morning, and looked upon them, and, behold, they were sad.7 And he asked Pharaoh's officers that were with him in the ward of his lord's house, saying, Wherefore look ye so sadly to day?8 And they said unto him, We have dreamed a dream, and there is no interpreter of it. And Joseph said unto them, Do not interpretations belong to God? tell me them, I pray you.9 And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, In my dream, behold, a vine was before me;10 And in the vine were three branches: and it was as though it budded, and her blossoms shot forth; and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes:11 And Pharaoh's cup was in my hand: and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh's cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand.12 And Joseph said unto him, This is the interpretation of it: The three branches are three days:13 Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thine head, and restore thee unto thy place: and thou shalt deliver Pharaoh's cup into his hand, after the former manner when thou wast his butler.14 But think on me when it shall be well with thee, and shew kindness, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house:15 For indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews: and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon.16 When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said unto Joseph, I also was in my dream, and, behold, I had three white baskets on my head:17 And in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of bakemeats for Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out of the basket upon my head.18 And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation thereof: The three baskets are three days:19 Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee, and shall hang thee on a tree; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee.\r\n\r\n20 And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh's birthday, that he made a feast unto all his servants: and he lifted up the head of the chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants.21 And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again; and he gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand:22 But he hanged the chief baker: as Joseph had interpreted to them.23 Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgat him.411 And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river.2 And, behold, there came up out of the river seven well favoured kine and fatfleshed; and they fed in a meadow.3 And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the river, ill favoured and leanfleshed; and stood by the other kine upon the brink of the river.4 And the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven well favoured and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke.5 And he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good.6 And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them.7 And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, it was a dream.8 And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but there was none that could interpret them unto Pharaoh.\r\n\r\n9 Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my faults this day:10 Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in ward in the captain of the guard's house, both me and the chief baker:11 And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream.12 And there was there with us a young man, an Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams; to each man according to his dream he did interpret.13 And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he restored unto mine office, and him he hanged.\r\n\r\n14 Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved himself, and changed his raiment, and came in unto Pharaoh.15 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and there is none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of thee, that thou canst understand a dream to interpret it.16 And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me: God shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace.\r\n\r\n17 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon the bank of the river:18 And, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, fatfleshed and well favoured; and they fed in a meadow:19 And, behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor and very ill favoured and leanfleshed, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness:20 And the lean and the ill favoured kine did eat up the first seven fat kine:21 And when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but they were still ill favoured, as at the beginning. So I awoke.22 And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up in one stalk, full and good:23 And, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them:24 And the thin ears devoured the seven good ears: and I told this unto the magicians; but there was none that could declare it to me.\r\n\r\n25 And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one: God hath shewed Pharaoh what he is about to do.26 The seven good kine are seven years; and the seven good ears are seven years: the dream is one.27 And the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after them are seven years; and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind shall be seven years of famine.28 This is the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: What God is about to do he sheweth unto Pharaoh.29 Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt:30 And there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the land;31 And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine following; for it shall be very grievous.32 And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; it is because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.\r\n\r\n33 Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt.34 Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint officers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years.35 And let them gather all the food of those good years that come, and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them keep food in the cities.36 And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the land perish not through the famine.\r\n\r\n37 And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants.38 And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find such a one as this is, a man in whom the Spirit of God is?39 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath shewed thee all this, there is none so discreet and wise as thou art:40 Thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled: only in the throne will I be greater than thou.41 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the land of Egypt.42 And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it upon Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck;43 And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had; and they cried before him, Bow the knee: and he made him ruler over all the land of Egypt.44 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.45 And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphnath\u2013paaneah; and he gave him to wife Asenath the daughter of Poti\u2013pherah priest of On. And Joseph went out over all the land of Egypt.\r\n\r\n46 And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt.47 And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls.48 And he gathered up all the food of the seven years, which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of the field, which was round about every city, laid he up in the same.49 And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much, until he left numbering; for it was without number.50 And unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came, which Asenath the daughter of Poti\u2013pherah priest of On bare unto him.51 And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: For God, said he, hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father's house.52 And the name of the second called he Ephraim: For God hath caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.\r\n\r\n53 And the seven years of plenteousness, that was in the land of Egypt, were ended.54 And the seven years of dearth began to come, according as Joseph had said: and the dearth was in all lands; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.55 And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians, Go unto Joseph; what he saith to you, do.56 And the famine was over all the face of the earth: And Joseph opened all the storehouses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and the famine waxed sore in the land of Egypt.57 And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy corn; because that the famine was so sore in all lands.421 Now when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt, Jacob said unto his sons, Why do ye look one upon another?2 And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is corn in Egypt: get you down thither, and buy for us from thence; that we may live, and not die.\r\n\r\n3 And Joseph's ten brethren went down to buy corn in Egypt.4 But Benjamin, Joseph's brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren; for he said, Lest peradventure mischief befall him.5 And the sons of Israel came to buy corn among those that came: for the famine was in the land of Canaan.6 And Joseph was the governor over the land, and he it was that sold to all the people of the land: and Joseph's brethren came, and bowed down themselves before him with their faces to the earth.\r\n\r\n7 And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself strange unto them, and spake roughly unto them; and he said unto them, Whence come ye? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food.8 And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him.9 And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and said unto them, Ye are spies; to see the nakedness of the land ye are come.10 And they said unto him, Nay, my lord, but to buy food are thy servants come.11 We are all one man's sons; we are true men, thy servants are no spies.12 And he said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of the land ye are come.13 And they said, Thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest is this day with our father, and one is not.14 And Joseph said unto them, That is it that I spake unto you, saying, Ye are spies:15 Hereby ye shall be proved: By the life of Pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence, except your youngest brother come hither.16 Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye shall be kept in prison, that your words may be proved, whether there be any truth in you: or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye are spies.17 And he put them all together into ward three days.18 And Joseph said unto them the third day, This do, and live; for I fear God:19 If ye be true men, let one of your brethren be bound in the house of your prison: go ye, carry corn for the famine of your houses:20 But bring your youngest brother unto me; so shall your words be verified, and ye shall not die. And they did so.\r\n\r\n21 And they said one to another, We are verily guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he besought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us.22 And Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I not unto you, saying, Do not sin against the child; and ye would not hear? therefore, behold, also his blood is required.23 And they knew not that Joseph understood them; for he spake unto them by an interpreter.24 And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and returned to them again, and communed with them, and took from them Simeon, and bound him before their eyes.\r\n\r\n25 Then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn, and to restore every man's money into his sack, and to give them provision for the way: and thus did he unto them.26 And they laded their asses with the corn, and departed thence.27 And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the inn, he espied his money; for, behold, it was in his sack's mouth.28 And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo, it is even in my sack: and their heart failed them, and they were afraid, saying one to another, What is this that God hath done unto us?\r\n\r\n29 And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan, and told him all that befell unto them; saying,30 The man, who is the lord of the land, spake roughly to us, and took us for spies of the country.31 And we said unto him, We are true men; we are no spies:32 We be twelve brethren, sons of our father; one is not, and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan.33 And the man, the lord of the country, said unto us, Hereby shall I know that ye are true men; leave one of your brethren here with me, and take food for the famine of your households, and be gone:34 And bring your youngest brother unto me: then shall I know that ye are no spies, but that ye are true men: so will I deliver you your brother, and ye shall traffick in the land.\r\n\r\n35 And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold, every man's bundle of money was in his sack: and when both they and their father saw the bundles of money, they were afraid.36 And Jacob their father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved of my children: Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will take Benjamin away: all these things are against me.37 And Reuben spake unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I bring him not to thee: deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him to thee again.38 And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he is left alone: if mischief befall him by the way in the which ye go, then shall ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.431 And the famine was sore in the land.2 And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the corn which they had brought out of Egypt, their father said unto them, Go again, buy us a little food.3 And Judah spake unto him, saying, The man did solemnly protest unto us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you.4 If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy thee food:5 But if thou wilt not send him, we will not go down: for the man said unto us, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you.6 And Israel said, Wherefore dealt ye so ill with me, as to tell the man whether ye had yet a brother?7 And they said, The man asked us straitly of our state, and of our kindred, saying, Is your father yet alive? have ye another brother? and we told him according to the tenor of these words: could we certainly know that he would say, Bring your brother down?8 And Judah said unto Israel his father, Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go; that we may live, and not die, both we, and thou, and also our little ones.9 I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him: if I bring him not unto thee, and set him before thee, then let me bear the blame for ever:10 For except we had lingered, surely now we had returned this second time.\r\n\r\n11 And their father Israel said unto them, If it must be so now, do this; take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels, and carry down the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spices, and myrrh, nuts, and almonds:12 And take double money in your hand; and the money that was brought again in the mouth of your sacks, carry it again in your hand; peradventure it was an oversight:13 Take also your brother, and arise, go again unto the man:14 And God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may send away your other brother, and Benjamin. If I be bereaved of my children, I am bereaved.\r\n\r\n15 And the men took that present, and they took double money in their hand, and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph.16 And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the ruler of his house, Bring these men home, and slay, and make ready; for these men shall dine with me at noon.17 And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men into Joseph's house.18 And the men were afraid, because they were brought into Joseph's house; and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, and our asses.19 And they came near to the steward of Joseph's house, and they communed with him at the door of the house,20 And said, O sir, we came indeed down at the first time to buy food:21 And it came to pass, when we came to the inn, that we opened our sacks, and, behold, every man's money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight: and we have brought it again in our hand.22 And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food: we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks.23 And he said, Peace be to you, fear not: your God, and the God of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks: I had your money. And he brought Simeon out unto them.24 And the man brought the men into Joseph's house, and gave them water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their asses provender.25 And they made ready the present against Joseph came at noon: for they heard that they should eat bread there.\r\n\r\n26 And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves to him to the earth.27 And he asked them of their welfare, and said, Is your father well, the old man of whom ye spake? Is he yet alive?28 And they answered, Thy servant our father is in good health, he is yet alive. And they bowed down their heads, and made obeisance.29 And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother's son, and said, Is this your younger brother, of whom ye spake unto me? And he said, God be gracious unto thee, my son.30 And Joseph made haste; for his bowels did yearn upon his brother: and he sought where to weep; and he entered into his chamber, and wept there.31 And he washed his face, and went out, and refrained himself, and said, Set on bread.32 And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians, which did eat with him, by themselves: because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that is an abomination unto the Egyptians.33 And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth: and the men marvelled one at another.34 And he took and sent messes unto them from before him: but Benjamin's mess was five times so much as any of theirs. And they drank, and were merry with him.441 And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men's sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put every man's money in his sack's mouth.2 And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack's mouth of the youngest, and his corn money. And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken.3 As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their asses.4 And when they were gone out of the city, and not yet far off, Joseph said unto his steward, Up, follow after the men; and when thou dost overtake them, say unto them, Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good?5 Is not this it in which my lord drinketh, and whereby indeed he divineth? ye have done evil in so doing.\r\n\r\n6 And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these same words.7 And they said unto him, Wherefore saith my lord these words? God forbid that thy servants should do according to this thing:8 Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks' mouths, we brought again unto thee out of the land of Canaan: how then should we steal out of thy lord's house silver or gold?9 With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, both let him die, and we also will be my lord's bondmen.10 And he said, Now also let it be according unto your words: he with whom it is found shall be my servant; and ye shall be blameless.11 Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack.12 And he searched, and began at the eldest, and left at the youngest: and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack.13 Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and returned to the city.\r\n\r\n14 And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph's house; for he was yet there: and they fell before him on the ground.15 And Joseph said unto them, What deed is this that ye have done? wot ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine?16 And Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants: behold, we are my lord's servants, both we, and he also with whom the cup is found.17 And he said, God forbid that I should do so: but the man in whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant; and as for you, get you up in peace unto your father.\r\n\r\n18 Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not thine anger burn against thy servant: for thou art even as Pharaoh.19 My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother?20 And we said unto my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him.21 And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me, that I may set mine eyes upon him.22 And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father: for if he should leave his father, his father would die.23 And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest brother come down with you, ye shall see my face no more.24 And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father, we told him the words of my lord.25 And our father said, Go again, and buy us a little food.26 And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be with us, then will we go down: for we may not see the man's face, except our youngest brother be with us.27 And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife bare me two sons:28 And the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in pieces; and I saw him not since:29 And if ye take this also from me, and mischief befall him, ye shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.30 Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad be not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad's life;31 It shall come to pass, when he seeth that the lad is not with us, that he will die: and thy servants shall bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave.32 For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father, saying, If I bring him not unto thee, then I shall bear the blame to my father for ever.33 Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren.34 For how shall I go up to my father, and the lad be not with me? lest peradventure I see the evil that shall come on my father.451 Then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood by him; and he cried, Cause every man to go out from me. And there stood no man with him, while Joseph made himself known unto his brethren.2 And he wept aloud: and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh heard.3 And Joseph said unto his brethren, I am Joseph; doth my father yet live? And his brethren could not answer him; for they were troubled at his presence.4 And Joseph said unto his brethren, Come near to me, I pray you. And they came near. And he said, I am Joseph your brother, whom ye sold into Egypt.5 Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that ye sold me hither: for God did send me before you to preserve life.6 For these two years hath the famine been in the land: and yet there are five years, in the which there shall neither be earing nor harvest.7 And God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance.8 So now it was not you that sent me hither, but God: and he hath made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt.9 Haste ye, and go up to my father, and say unto him, Thus saith thy son Joseph, God hath made me lord of all Egypt: come down unto me, tarry not:10 And thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen, and thou shalt be near unto me, thou, and thy children, and thy children's children, and thy flocks, and thy herds, and all that thou hast:11 And there will I nourish thee; for yet there are five years of famine; lest thou, and thy household, and all that thou hast, come to poverty.12 And, behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that it is my mouth that speaketh unto you.13 And ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all that ye have seen; and ye shall haste and bring down my father hither.14 And he fell upon his brother Benjamin's neck, and wept; and Benjamin wept upon his neck.15 Moreover he kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them: and after that his brethren talked with him.\r\n\r\n16 And the fame thereof was heard in Pharaoh's house, saying, Joseph's brethren are come: and it pleased Pharaoh well, and his servants.17 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Say unto thy brethren, This do ye; lade your beasts, and go, get you unto the land of Canaan;18 And take your father and your households, and come unto me: and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat of the land.19 Now thou art commanded, this do ye; take you wagons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and bring your father, and come.20 Also regard not your stuff; for the good of all the land of Egypt is yours.21 And the children of Israel did so: and Joseph gave them wagons, according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for the way.22 To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment; but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver, and five changes of raiment.23 And to his father he sent after this manner; ten asses laden with the good things of Egypt, and ten she asses laden with corn and bread and meat for his father by the way.24 So he sent his brethren away, and they departed: and he said unto them, See that ye fall not out by the way.\r\n\r\n25 And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan unto Jacob their father,26 And told him, saying, Joseph is yet alive, and he is governor over all the land of Egypt. And Jacob's heart fainted, for he believed them not.27 And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said unto them: and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived:28 And Israel said, It is enough; Joseph my son is yet alive: I will go and see him before I die.461 And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to Beer\u2013sheba, and offered sacrifices unto the God of his father Isaac.2 And God spake unto Israel in the visions of the night, and said, Jacob, Jacob. And he said, Here am I.3 And he said, I am God, the God of thy father: fear not to go down into Egypt; for I will there make of thee a great nation:4 I will go down with thee into Egypt; and I will also surely bring thee up again: and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes.\r\n\r\n5 And Jacob rose up from Beer\u2013sheba: and the sons of Israel carried Jacob their father, and their little ones, and their wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him.6 And they took their cattle, and their goods, which they had gotten in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob, and all his seed with him:7 His sons, and his sons' sons with him, his daughters, and his sons' daughters, and all his seed brought he with him into Egypt.\r\n\r\n8 And these are the names of the children of Israel, which came into Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Reuben, Jacob's firstborn.9 And the sons of Reuben; Hanoch, and Phallu, and Hezron, and Carmi.\r\n\r\n10 And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman.\r\n\r\n11 And the sons of Levi; Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.\r\n\r\n12 And the sons of Judah; Er, and Onan, and Shelah, and Pharez, and Zerah: but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. And the sons of Pharez were Hezron and Hamul.\r\n\r\n13 And the sons of Issachar; Tola, and Phuvah, and Job, and Shimron.\r\n\r\n14 And the sons of Zebulun; Sered, and Elon, and Jahleel.15 These be the sons of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob in Padan\u2013aram, with his daughter Dinah: all the souls of his sons and his daughters were thirty and three.\r\n\r\n16 And the sons of Gad; Ziphion, and Haggi, Shuni, and Ezbon, Eri, and Arodi, and Areli.\r\n\r\n17 And the sons of Asher; Jimnah, and Ishuah, and Isui, and Beriah, and Serah their sister: and the sons of Beriah; Heber, and Malchiel.18 These are the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah his daughter, and these she bare unto Jacob, even sixteen souls.19 The sons of Rachel Jacob's wife; Joseph, and Benjamin.\r\n\r\n20 And unto Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim, which Asenath the daughter of Poti\u2013pherah priest of On bare unto him.\r\n\r\n21 And the sons of Benjamin were Belah, and Becher, and Ashbel, Gera, and Naaman, Ehi, and Rosh, Muppim, and Huppim, and Ard.22 These are the sons of Rachel, which were born to Jacob: all the souls were fourteen.\r\n\r\n23 And the sons of Dan; Hushim.\r\n\r\n24 And the sons of Naphtali; Jahzeel, and Guni, and Jezer, and Shillem.25 These are the sons of Bilhah, which Laban gave unto Rachel his daughter, and she bare these unto Jacob: all the souls were seven.26 All the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt, which came out of his loins, besides Jacob's sons' wives, all the souls were threescore and six;27 And the sons of Joseph, which were born him in Egypt, were two souls: all the souls of the house of Jacob, which came into Egypt, were threescore and ten.\r\n\r\n28 And he sent Judah before him unto Joseph, to direct his face unto Goshen; and they came into the land of Goshen.29 And Joseph made ready his chariot, and went up to meet Israel his father, to Goshen, and presented himself unto him; and he fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while.30 And Israel said unto Joseph, Now let me die, since I have seen thy face, because thou art yet alive.31 And Joseph said unto his brethren, and unto his father's house, I will go up, and shew Pharaoh, and say unto him, My brethren, and my father's house, which were in the land of Canaan, are come unto me;32 And the men are shepherds, for their trade hath been to feed cattle; and they have brought their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have.33 And it shall come to pass, when Pharaoh shall call you, and shall say, What is your occupation?34 That ye shall say, Thy servants' trade hath been about cattle from our youth even until now, both we, and also our fathers: that ye may dwell in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd is an abomination unto the Egyptians.471 Then Joseph came and told Pharaoh, and said, My father and my brethren, and their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have, are come out of the land of Canaan; and, behold, they are in the land of Goshen.2 And he took some of his brethren, even five men, and presented them unto Pharaoh.3 And Pharaoh said unto his brethren, What is your occupation? And they said unto Pharaoh, Thy servants are shepherds, both we, and also our fathers.4 They said moreover unto Pharaoh, For to sojourn in the land are we come; for thy servants have no pasture for their flocks; for the famine is sore in the land of Canaan: now therefore, we pray thee, let thy servants dwell in the land of Goshen.5 And Pharaoh spake unto Joseph, saying, Thy father and thy brethren are come unto thee:6 The land of Egypt is before thee; in the best of the land make thy father and brethren to dwell; in the land of Goshen let them dwell: and if thou knowest any men of activity among them, then make them rulers over my cattle.7 And Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and set him before Pharaoh: and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.8 And Pharaoh said unto Jacob, How old art thou?9 And Jacob said unto Pharaoh, The days of the years of my pilgrimage are an hundred and thirty years: few and evil have the days of the years of my life been, and have not attained unto the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage.10 And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from before Pharaoh.\r\n\r\n11 And Joseph placed his father and his brethren, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.12 And Joseph nourished his father, and his brethren, and all his father's household, with bread, according to their families.\r\n\r\n13 And there was no bread in all the land; for the famine was very sore, so that the land of Egypt and all the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine.14 And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the corn which they bought: and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's house.15 And when money failed in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came unto Joseph, and said, Give us bread: for why should we die in thy presence? for the money faileth.16 And Joseph said, Give your cattle; and I will give you for your cattle, if money fail.17 And they brought their cattle unto Joseph: and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for horses, and for the flocks, and for the cattle of the herds, and for the asses: and he fed them with bread for all their cattle for that year.18 When that year was ended, they came unto him the second year, and said unto him, We will not hide it from my lord, how that our money is spent; my lord also hath our herds of cattle; there is not ought left in the sight of my lord, but our bodies, and our lands:19 Wherefore shall we die before thine eyes, both we and our land? buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants unto Pharaoh: and give us seed, that we may live, and not die, that the land be not desolate.20 And Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the Egyptians sold every man his field, because the famine prevailed over them: so the land became Pharaoh's.21 And as for the people, he removed them to cities from one end of the borders of Egypt even to the other end thereof.22 Only the land of the priests bought he not; for the priests had a portion assigned them of Pharaoh, and did eat their portion which Pharaoh gave them: wherefore they sold not their lands.23 Then Joseph said unto the people, Behold, I have bought you this day and your land for Pharaoh: lo, here is seed for you, and ye shall sow the land.24 And it shall come to pass in the increase, that ye shall give the fifth part unto Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your own, for seed of the field, and for your food, and for them of your households, and for food for your little ones.25 And they said, Thou hast saved our lives: let us find grace in the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh's servants.26 And Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt unto this day, that Pharaoh should have the fifth part; except the land of the priests only, which became not Pharaoh's.\r\n\r\n27 And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the country of Goshen; and they had possessions therein, and grew, and multiplied exceedingly.28 And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years: so the whole age of Jacob was an hundred forty and seven years.29 And the time drew nigh that Israel must die: and he called his son Joseph, and said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight, put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me; bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt:30 But I will lie with my fathers, and thou shalt carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their buryingplace. And he said, I will do as thou hast said.31 And he said, Swear unto me. And he sware unto him. And Israel bowed himself upon the bed's head.481 And it came to pass after these things, that one told Joseph, Behold, thy father is sick: and he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim.2 And one told Jacob, and said, Behold, thy son Joseph cometh unto thee: and Israel strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed.3 And Jacob said unto Joseph, God Almighty appeared unto me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me,4 And said unto me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and I will make of thee a multitude of people; and will give this land to thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession.\r\n\r\n5 And now thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, which were born unto thee in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee into Egypt, are mine; as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine.6 And thy issue, which thou begettest after them, shall be thine, and shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance.7 And as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan in the way, when yet there was but a little way to come unto Ephrath: and I buried her there in the way of Ephrath; the same is Beth\u2013lehem.\r\n\r\n8 And Israel beheld Joseph's sons, and said, Who are these?9 And Joseph said unto his father, They are my sons, whom God hath given me in this place. And he said, Bring them, I pray thee, unto me, and I will bless them.10 Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not see. And he brought them near unto him; and he kissed them, and embraced them.11 And Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face: and, lo, God hath shewed me also thy seed.12 And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth.13 And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel's left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel's right hand, and brought them near unto him.14 And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon Ephraim's head, who was the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh's head, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh was the firstborn.\r\n\r\n15 And he blessed Joseph, and said, God, before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God which fed me all my life long unto this day,16 The Angel which redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.17 And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he held up his father's hand, to remove it from Ephraim's head unto Manasseh's head.18 And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father: for this is the firstborn; put thy right hand upon his head.19 And his father refused, and said, I know it, my son, I know it: he also shall become a people, and he also shall be great: but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a multitude of nations.20 And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee shall Israel bless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh: and he set Ephraim before Manasseh.21 And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I die: but God shall be with you, and bring you again unto the land of your fathers.22 Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow.491 And Jacob called unto his sons, and said, Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the last days.2 Gather yourselves together, and hear, ye sons of Jacob; and hearken unto Israel your father.\r\n\r\n3 Reuben, thou art my firstborn, my might, and the beginning of my strength, the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power:4 Unstable as water, thou shalt not excel; because thou wentest up to thy father's bed; then defiledst thou it: he went up to my couch.\r\n\r\n5 Simeon and Levi are brethren; instruments of cruelty are in their habitations.6 O my soul, come not thou into their secret; unto their assembly, mine honour, be not thou united: for in their anger they slew a man, and in their selfwill they digged down a wall.7 Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce; and their wrath, for it was cruel: I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel.\r\n\r\n8 Judah, thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise: thy hand shall be in the neck of thine enemies; thy father's children shall bow down before thee.9 Judah is a lion's whelp: from the prey, my son, thou art gone up: he stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion; who shall rouse him up?10 The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him shall the gathering of the people be.11 Binding his foal unto the vine, and his ass's colt unto the choice vine; he washed his garments in wine, and his clothes in the blood of grapes:12 His eyes shall be red with wine, and his teeth white with milk.\r\n\r\n13 Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea; and he shall be for an haven of ships; and his border shall be unto Zidon.\r\n\r\n14 Issachar is a strong ass couching down between two burdens:15 And he saw that rest was good, and the land that it was pleasant; and bowed his shoulder to bear, and became a servant unto tribute.\r\n\r\n16 Dan shall judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel.17 Dan shall be a serpent by the way, an adder in the path, that biteth the horse heels, so that his rider shall fall backward.18 I have waited for thy salvation, O Lord.\r\n\r\n19 Gad, a troop shall overcome him: but he shall overcome at the last.\r\n\r\n20 Out of Asher his bread shall be fat, and he shall yield royal dainties.\r\n\r\n21 Naphtali is a hind let loose: he giveth goodly words.\r\n\r\n22 Joseph is a fruitful bough, even a fruitful bough by a well; whose branches run over the wall:23 The archers have sorely grieved him, and shot at him, and hated him:24 But his bow abode in strength, and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty God of Jacob; (from thence is the shepherd, the stone of Israel:)25 Even by the God of thy father, who shall help thee; and by the Almighty, who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above, blessings of the deep that lieth under, blessings of the breasts, and of the womb:26 The blessings of thy father have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills: they shall be on the head of Joseph, and on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren.\r\n\r\n27 Benjamin shall ravin as a wolf: in the morning he shall devour the prey, and at night he shall divide the spoil.\r\n\r\n28 All these are the twelve tribes of Israel: and this is it that their father spake unto them, and blessed them; every one according to his blessing he blessed them.29 And he charged them, and said unto them, I am to be gathered unto my people: bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite,30 In the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field of Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a buryingplace.31 There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah.32 The purchase of the field and of the cave that is therein was from the children of Heth.33 And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons, he gathered up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the ghost, and was gathered unto his people.501 And Joseph fell upon his father's face, and wept upon him, and kissed him.2 And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father: and the physicians embalmed Israel.3 And forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled the days of those which are embalmed: and the Egyptians mourned for him threescore and ten days.4 And when the days of his mourning were past, Joseph spake unto the house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found grace in your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,5 My father made me swear, saying, Lo, I die: in my grave which I have digged for me in the land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury me. Now therefore let me go up, I pray thee, and bury my father, and I will come again.6 And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy father, according as he made thee swear.\r\n\r\n7 And Joseph went up to bury his father: and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt,8 And all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his father's house: only their little ones, and their flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen.9 And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it was a very great company.10 And they came to the threshingfloor of Atad, which is beyond Jordan, and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation: and he made a mourning for his father seven days.11 And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, This is a grievous mourning to the Egyptians: wherefore the name of it was called Abel\u2013mizraim, which is beyond Jordan.12 And his sons did unto him according as he commanded them:13 For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field for a possession of a buryingplace of Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre.\r\n\r\n14 And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brethren, and all that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father.\r\n\r\n15 And when Joseph's brethren saw that their father was dead, they said, Joseph will peradventure hate us, and will certainly requite us all the evil which we did unto him.16 And they sent a messenger unto Joseph, saying, Thy father did command before he died, saying,17 So shall ye say unto Joseph, Forgive, I pray thee now, the trespass of thy brethren, and their sin; for they did unto thee evil: and now, we pray thee, forgive the trespass of the servants of the God of thy father. And Joseph wept when they spake unto him.18 And his brethren also went and fell down before his face; and they said, Behold, we be thy servants.19 And Joseph said unto them, Fear not: for am I in the place of God?20 But as for you, ye thought evil against me; but God meant it unto good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much people alive.21 Now therefore fear ye not: I will nourish you, and your little ones. And he comforted them, and spake kindly unto them.\r\n\r\n22 And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father's house: and Joseph lived an hundred and ten years.23 And Joseph saw Ephraim's children of the third generation: the children also of Machir the son of Manasseh were brought up upon Joseph's knees.24 And Joseph said unto his brethren, I die: and God will surely visit you, and bring you out of this land unto the land which he sware to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.25 And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence.26 So Joseph died, being an hundred and ten years old: and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.\r\n\r\n11 And the Lord called unto Moses, and spake unto him out of the tabernacle of the congregation, saying,2 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, If any man of you bring an offering unto the Lord, ye shall bring your offering of the cattle, even of the herd, and of the flock.\r\n\r\n3 If his offering be a burnt sacrifice of the herd, let him offer a male without blemish: he shall offer it of his own voluntary will at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the Lord.4 And he shall put his hand upon the head of the burnt offering; and it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him.5 And he shall kill the bullock before the Lord: and the priests, Aaron's sons, shall bring the blood, and sprinkle the blood round about upon the altar that is by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.6 And he shall flay the burnt offering, and cut it into his pieces.7 And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire upon the altar, and lay the wood in order upon the fire:8 And the priests, Aaron's sons, shall lay the parts, the head, and the fat, in order upon the wood that is on the fire which is upon the altar:9 But his inwards and his legs shall he wash in water: and the priest shall burn all on the altar, to be a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the Lord.\r\n\r\n10 And if his offering be of the flocks, namely, of the sheep, or of the goats, for a burnt sacrifice; he shall bring it a male without blemish.11 And he shall kill it on the side of the altar northward before the Lord: and the priests, Aaron's sons, shall sprinkle his blood round about upon the altar.12 And he shall cut it into his pieces, with his head and his fat: and the priest shall lay them in order on the wood that is on the fire which is upon the altar:13 But he shall wash the inwards and the legs with water: and the priest shall bring it all, and burn it upon the altar: it is a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the Lord.\r\n\r\n14 And if the burnt sacrifice for his offering to the Lord be of fowls, then he shall bring his offering of turtledoves, or of young pigeons.15 And the priest shall bring it unto the altar, and wring off his head, and burn it on the altar; and the blood thereof shall be wrung out at the side of the altar:16 And he shall pluck away his crop with his feathers, and cast it beside the altar on the east part, by the place of the ashes:17 And he shall cleave it with the wings thereof, but shall not divide it asunder: and the priest shall burn it upon the altar, upon the wood that is upon the fire: it is a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the Lord.21 And when any will offer a meat offering unto the Lord, his offering shall be of fine flour; and he shall pour oil upon it, and put frankincense thereon:2 And he shall bring it to Aaron's sons the priests: and he shall take thereout his handful of the flour thereof, and of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof; and the priest shall burn the memorial of it upon the altar, to be an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the Lord:3 And the remnant of the meat offering shall be Aaron's and his sons': it is a thing most holy of the offerings of the Lord made by fire.\r\n\r\n4 And if thou bring an oblation of a meat offering baken in the oven, it shall be unleavened cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, or unleavened wafers anointed with oil.\r\n\r\n5 And if thy oblation be a meat offering baken in a pan, it shall be of fine flour unleavened, mingled with oil.6 Thou shalt part it in pieces, and pour oil thereon: it is a meat offering.\r\n\r\n7 And if thy oblation be a meat offering baken in the fryingpan, it shall be made of fine flour with oil.8 And thou shalt bring the meat offering that is made of these things unto the Lord: and when it is presented unto the priest, he shall bring it unto the altar.9 And the priest shall take from the meat offering a memorial thereof, and shall burn it upon the altar: it is an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the Lord.10 And that which is left of the meat offering shall be Aaron's and his sons': it is a thing most holy of the offerings of the Lord made by fire.\r\n\r\n11 No meat offering, which ye shall bring unto the Lord, shall be made with leaven: for ye shall burn no leaven, nor any honey, in any offering of the Lord made by fire.\r\n\r\n12 As for the oblation of the firstfruits, ye shall offer them unto the Lord: but they shall not be burnt on the altar for a sweet savour.13 And every oblation of thy meat offering shalt thou season with salt; neither shalt thou suffer the salt of the covenant of thy God to be lacking from thy meat offering: with all thine offerings thou shalt offer salt.14 And if thou offer a meat offering of thy firstfruits unto the Lord, thou shalt offer for the meat offering of thy firstfruits green ears of corn dried by the fire, even corn beaten out of full ears.15 And thou shalt put oil upon it, and lay frankincense thereon: it is a meat offering.16 And the priest shall burn the memorial of it, part of the beaten corn thereof, and part of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof: it is an offering made by fire unto the Lord.31 And if his oblation be a sacrifice of peace offering, if he offer it of the herd; whether it be a male or female, he shall offer it without blemish before the Lord.2 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering, and kill it at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and Aaron's sons the priests shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about.3 And he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace offering an offering made by fire unto the Lord; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards,4 And the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away.5 And Aaron's sons shall burn it on the altar upon the burnt sacrifice, which is upon the wood that is on the fire: it is an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the Lord.\r\n\r\n6 And if his offering for a sacrifice of peace offering unto the Lord be of the flock; male or female, he shall offer it without blemish.7 If he offer a lamb for his offering, then shall he offer it before the Lord.8 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering, and kill it before the tabernacle of the congregation: and Aaron's sons shall sprinkle the blood thereof round about upon the altar.9 And he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace offering an offering made by fire unto the Lord; the fat thereof, and the whole rump, it shall he take off hard by the backbone; and the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards,10 And the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away.11 And the priest shall burn it upon the altar: it is the food of the offering made by fire unto the Lord.\r\n\r\n12 And if his offering be a goat, then he shall offer it before the Lord.13 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of it, and kill it before the tabernacle of the congregation: and the sons of Aaron shall sprinkle the blood thereof upon the altar round about.14 And he shall offer thereof his offering, even an offering made by fire unto the Lord; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards,15 And the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away.16 And the priest shall burn them upon the altar: it is the food of the offering made by fire for a sweet savour: all the fat is the Lord's.17 It shall be a perpetual statute for your generations throughout all your dwellings, that ye eat neither fat nor blood.41 And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,2 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a soul shall sin through ignorance against any of the commandments of the Lord concerning things which ought not to be done, and shall do against any of them:3 If the priest that is anointed do sin according to the sin of the people; then let him bring for his sin, which he hath sinned, a young bullock without blemish unto the Lord for a sin offering.4 And he shall bring the bullock unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the Lord; and shall lay his hand upon the bullock's head, and kill the bullock before the Lord.5 And the priest that is anointed shall take of the bullock's blood, and bring it to the tabernacle of the congregation:6 And the priest shall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle of the blood seven times before the Lord, before the vail of the sanctuary.7 And the priest shall put some of the blood upon the horns of the altar of sweet incense before the Lord, which is in the tabernacle of the congregation; and shall pour all the blood of the bullock at the bottom of the altar of the burnt offering, which is at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.8 And he shall take off from it all the fat of the bullock for the sin offering; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards,9 And the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away,10 As it was taken off from the bullock of the sacrifice of peace offerings: and the priest shall burn them upon the altar of the burnt offering.11 And the skin of the bullock, and all his flesh, with his head, and with his legs, and his inwards, and his dung,12 Even the whole bullock shall he carry forth without the camp unto a clean place, where the ashes are poured out, and burn him on the wood with fire: where the ashes are poured out shall he be burnt.\r\n\r\n13 And if the whole congregation of Israel sin through ignorance, and the thing be hid from the eyes of the assembly, and they have done somewhat against any of the commandments of the Lord concerning things which should not be done, and are guilty;14 When the sin, which they have sinned against it, is known, then the congregation shall offer a young bullock for the sin, and bring him before the tabernacle of the congregation.15 And the elders of the congregation shall lay their hands upon the head of the bullock before the Lord: and the bullock shall be killed before the Lord.16 And the priest that is anointed shall bring of the bullock's blood to the tabernacle of the congregation:17 And the priest shall dip his finger in some of the blood, and sprinkle it seven times before the Lord, even before the vail.18 And he shall put some of the blood upon the horns of the altar which is before the Lord, that is in the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall pour out all the blood at the bottom of the altar of the burnt offering, which is at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.19 And he shall take all his fat from him, and burn it upon the altar.20 And he shall do with the bullock as he did with the bullock for a sin offering, so shall he do with this: and the priest shall make an atonement for them, and it shall be forgiven them.21 And he shall carry forth the bullock without the camp, and burn him as he burned the first bullock: it is a sin offering for the congregation.\r\n\r\n22 When a ruler hath sinned, and done somewhat through ignorance against any of the commandments of the Lord his God concerning things which should not be done, and is guilty;23 Or if his sin, wherein he hath sinned, come to his knowledge; he shall bring his offering, a kid of the goats, a male without blemish:24 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the goat, and kill it in the place where they kill the burnt offering before the Lord: it is a sin offering.25 And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with his finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and shall pour out his blood at the bottom of the altar of burnt offering.26 And he shall burn all his fat upon the altar, as the fat of the sacrifice of peace offerings: and the priest shall make an atonement for him as concerning his sin, and it shall be forgiven him.\r\n\r\n27 And if any one of the common people sin through ignorance, while he doeth somewhat against any of the commandments of the Lord concerning things which ought not to be done, and be guilty;28 Or if his sin, which he hath sinned, come to his knowledge: then he shall bring his offering, a kid of the goats, a female without blemish, for his sin which he hath sinned.29 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering, and slay the sin offering in the place of the burnt offering.30 And the priest shall take of the blood thereof with his finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and shall pour out all the blood thereof at the bottom of the altar.31 And he shall take away all the fat thereof, as the fat is taken away from off the sacrifice of peace offerings; and the priest shall burn it upon the altar for a sweet savour unto the Lord; and the priest shall make an atonement for him, and it shall be forgiven him.32 And if he bring a lamb for a sin offering, he shall bring it a female without blemish.33 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering, and slay it for a sin offering in the place where they kill the burnt offering.34 And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with his finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and shall pour out all the blood thereof at the bottom of the altar:35 And he shall take away all the fat thereof, as the fat of the lamb is taken away from the sacrifice of the peace offerings; and the priest shall burn them upon the altar, according to the offerings made by fire unto the Lord: and the priest shall make an atonement for his sin that he hath committed, and it shall be forgiven him.51 And if a soul sin, and hear the voice of swearing, and is a witness, whether he hath seen or known of it; if he do not utter it, then he shall bear his iniquity.2 Or if a soul touch any unclean thing, whether it be a carcase of an unclean beast, or a carcase of unclean cattle, or the carcase of unclean creeping things, and if it be hidden from him; he also shall be unclean, and guilty.3 Or if he touch the uncleanness of man, whatsoever uncleanness it be that a man shall be defiled withal, and it be hid from him; when he knoweth of it, then he shall be guilty.4 Or if a soul swear, pronouncing with his lips to do evil, or to do good, whatsoever it be that a man shall pronounce with an oath, and it be hid from him; when he knoweth of it, then he shall be guilty in one of these.5 And it shall be, when he shall be guilty in one of these things, that he shall confess that he hath sinned in that thing:6 And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the Lord for his sin which he hath sinned, a female from the flock, a lamb or a kid of the goats, for a sin offering; and the priest shall make an atonement for him concerning his sin.\r\n\r\n7 And if he be not able to bring a lamb, then he shall bring for his trespass, which he hath committed, two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, unto the Lord; one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering.8 And he shall bring them unto the priest, who shall offer that which is for the sin offering first, and wring off his head from his neck, but shall not divide it asunder:9 And he shall sprinkle of the blood of the sin offering upon the side of the altar; and the rest of the blood shall be wrung out at the bottom of the altar: it is a sin offering.10 And he shall offer the second for a burnt offering, according to the manner: and the priest shall make an atonement for him for his sin which he hath sinned, and it shall be forgiven him.\r\n\r\n11 But if he be not able to bring two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, then he that sinned shall bring for his offering the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a sin offering; he shall put no oil upon it, neither shall he put any frankincense thereon: for it is a sin offering.12 Then shall he bring it to the priest, and the priest shall take his handful of it, even a memorial thereof, and burn it on the altar, according to the offerings made by fire unto the Lord: it is a sin offering.13 And the priest shall make an atonement for him as touching his sin that he hath sinned in one of these, and it shall be forgiven him: and the remnant shall be the priest's, as a meat offering.\r\n\r\n14 And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,15 If a soul commit a trespass, and sin through ignorance, in the holy things of the Lord; then he shall bring for his trespass unto the Lord a ram without blemish out of the flocks, with thy estimation by shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary, for a trespass offering:16 And he shall make amends for the harm that he hath done in the holy thing, and shall add the fifth part thereto, and give it unto the priest: and the priest shall make an atonement for him with the ram of the trespass offering, and it shall be forgiven him.\r\n\r\n17 And if a soul sin, and commit any of these things which are forbidden to be done by the commandments of the Lord; though he wist it not, yet is he guilty, and shall bear his iniquity.18 And he shall bring a ram without blemish out of the flock, with thy estimation, for a trespass offering, unto the priest: and the priest shall make an atonement for him concerning his ignorance wherein he erred and wist it not, and it shall be forgiven him.19 It is a trespass offering: he hath certainly trespassed against the Lord.61 And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,2 If a soul sin, and commit a trespass against the Lord, and lie unto his neighbour in that which was delivered him to keep, or in fellowship, or in a thing taken away by violence, or hath deceived his neighbour;3 Or have found that which was lost, and lieth concerning it, and sweareth falsely; in any of all these that a man doeth, sinning therein:4 Then it shall be, because he hath sinned, and is guilty, that he shall restore that which he took violently away, or the thing which he hath deceitfully gotten, or that which was delivered him to keep, or the lost thing which he found,5 Or all that about which he hath sworn falsely; he shall even restore it in the principal, and shall add the fifth part more thereto, and give it unto him to whom it appertaineth, in the day of his trespass offering.6 And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the Lord, a ram without blemish out of the flock, with thy estimation, for a trespass offering, unto the priest:7 And the priest shall make an atonement for him before the Lord: and it shall be forgiven him for any thing of all that he hath done in trespassing therein.\r\n\r\n8 And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,9 Command Aaron and his sons, saying, This is the law of the burnt offering: It is the burnt offering, because of the burning upon the altar all night unto the morning, and the fire of the altar shall be burning in it.10 And the priest shall put on his linen garment, and his linen breeches shall he put upon his flesh, and take up the ashes which the fire hath consumed with the burnt offering on the altar, and he shall put them beside the altar.11 And he shall put off his garments, and put on other garments, and carry forth the ashes without the camp unto a clean place.12 And the fire upon the altar shall be burning in it; it shall not be put out: and the priest shall burn wood on it every morning, and lay the burnt offering in order upon it; and he shall burn thereon the fat of the peace offerings.13 The fire shall ever be burning upon the altar; it shall never go out.\r\n\r\n14 And this is the law of the meat offering: the sons of Aaron shall offer it before the Lord, before the altar.15 And he shall take of it his handful, of the flour of the meat offering, and of the oil thereof, and all the frankincense which is upon the meat offering, and shall burn it upon the altar for a sweet savour, even the memorial of it, unto the Lord.16 And the remainder thereof shall Aaron and his sons eat: with unleavened bread shall it be eaten in the holy place; in the court of the tabernacle of the congregation they shall eat it.17 It shall not be baken with leaven. I have given it unto them for their portion of my offerings made by fire; it is most holy, as is the sin offering, and as the trespass offering.18 All the males among the children of Aaron shall eat of it. It shall be a statute for ever in your generations concerning the offerings of the Lord made by fire: every one that toucheth them shall be holy.\r\n\r\n19 And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,20 This is the offering of Aaron and of his sons, which they shall offer unto the Lord in the day when he is anointed; the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a meat offering perpetual, half of it in the morning, and half thereof at night.21 In a pan it shall be made with oil; and when it is baken, thou shalt bring it in: and the baken pieces of the meat offering shalt thou offer for a sweet savour unto the Lord.22 And the priest of his sons that is anointed in his stead shall offer it: it is a statute for ever unto the Lord; it shall be wholly burnt.23 For every meat offering for the priest shall be wholly burnt: it shall not be eaten.\r\n\r\n24 And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,25 Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, saying, This is the law of the sin offering: In the place where the burnt offering is killed shall the sin offering be killed before the Lord: it is most holy.26 The priest that offereth it for sin shall eat it: in the holy place shall it be eaten, in the court of the tabernacle of the congregation.27 Whatsoever shall touch the flesh thereof shall be holy: and when there is sprinkled of the blood thereof upon any garment, thou shalt wash that whereon it was sprinkled in the holy place.28 But the earthen vessel wherein it is sodden shall be broken: and if it be sodden in a brasen pot, it shall be both scoured, and rinsed in water.29 All the males among the priests shall eat thereof: it is most holy.30 And no sin offering, whereof any of the blood is brought into the tabernacle of the congregation to reconcile withal in the holy place, shall be eaten: it shall be burnt in the fire.71 Likewise this is the law of the trespass offering: it is most holy.2 In the place where they kill the burnt offering shall they kill the trespass offering: and the blood thereof shall he sprinkle round about upon the altar.3 And he shall offer of it all the fat thereof; the rump, and the fat that covereth the inwards,4 And the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by the flanks, and the caul that is above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away:5 And the priest shall burn them upon the altar for an offering made by fire unto the Lord: it is a trespass offering.6 Every male among the priests shall eat thereof: it shall be eaten in the holy place: it is most holy.7 As the sin offering is, so is the trespass offering: there is one law for them: the priest that maketh atonement therewith shall have it.8 And the priest that offereth any man's burnt offering, even the priest shall have to himself the skin of the burnt offering which he hath offered.9 And all the meat offering that is baken in the oven, and all that is dressed in the fryingpan, and in the pan, shall be the priest's that offereth it.10 And every meat offering, mingled with oil, and dry, shall all the sons of Aaron have, one as much as another.\r\n\r\n11 And this is the law of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which he shall offer unto the Lord.12 If he offer it for a thanksgiving, then he shall offer with the sacrifice of thanksgiving unleavened cakes mingled with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and cakes mingled with oil, of fine flour, fried.13 Besides the cakes, he shall offer for his offering leavened bread with the sacrifice of thanksgiving of his peace offerings.14 And of it he shall offer one out of the whole oblation for an heave offering unto the Lord, and it shall be the priest's that sprinkleth the blood of the peace offerings.15 And the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanksgiving shall be eaten the same day that it is offered; he shall not leave any of it until the morning.16 But if the sacrifice of his offering be a vow, or a voluntary offering, it shall be eaten the same day that he offereth his sacrifice: and on the morrow also the remainder of it shall be eaten:17 But the remainder of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day shall be burnt with fire.18 And if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings be eaten at all on the third day, it shall not be accepted, neither shall it be imputed unto him that offereth it: it shall be an abomination, and the soul that eateth of it shall bear his iniquity.19 And the flesh that toucheth any unclean thing shall not be eaten; it shall be burnt with fire: and as for the flesh, all that be clean shall eat thereof.20 But the soul that eateth of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings, that pertain unto the Lord, having his uncleanness upon him, even that soul shall be cut off from his people.21 Moreover the soul that shall touch any unclean thing, as the uncleanness of man, or any unclean beast, or any abominable unclean thing, and eat of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which pertain unto the Lord, even that soul shall be cut off from his people.\r\n\r\n22 And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,23 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, Ye shall eat no manner of fat, of ox, or of sheep, or of goat.24 And the fat of the beast that dieth of itself, and the fat of that which is torn with beasts, may be used in any other use: but ye shall in no wise eat of it.25 For whosoever eateth the fat of the beast, of which men offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord, even the soul that eateth it shall be cut off from his people.26 Moreover ye shall eat no manner of blood, whether it be of fowl or of beast, in any of your dwellings.27 Whatsoever soul it be that eateth any manner of blood, even that soul shall be cut off from his people.\r\n\r\n28 And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,29 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, He that offereth the sacrifice of his peace offerings unto the Lord shall bring his oblation unto the Lord of the sacrifice of his peace offerings.30 His own hands shall bring the offerings of the Lord made by fire, the fat with the breast, it shall he bring, that the breast may be waved for a wave offering before the Lord.31 And the priest shall burn the fat upon the altar: but the breast shall be Aaron's and his sons'.32 And the right shoulder shall ye give unto the priest for an heave offering of the sacrifices of your peace offerings.33 He among the sons of Aaron, that offereth the blood of the peace offerings, and the fat, shall have the right shoulder for his part.34 For the wave breast and the heave shoulder have I taken of the children of Israel from off the sacrifices of their peace offerings, and have given them unto Aaron the priest and unto his sons by a statute for ever from among the children of Israel.\r\n\r\n35 This is the portion of the anointing of Aaron, and of the anointing of his sons, out of the offerings of the Lord made by fire, in the day when he presented them to minister unto the Lord in the priest's office;36 Which the Lord commanded to be given them of the children of Israel, in the day that he anointed them, by a statute for ever throughout their generations.37 This is the law of the burnt offering, of the meat offering, and of the sin offering, and of the trespass offering, and of the consecrations, and of the sacrifice of the peace offerings;38 Which the Lord commanded Moses in mount Sinai, in the day that he commanded the children of Israel to offer their oblations unto the Lord, in the wilderness of Sinai.81 And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,2 Take Aaron and his sons with him, and the garments, and the anointing oil, and a bullock for the sin offering, and two rams, and a basket of unleavened bread;3 And gather thou all the congregation together unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.4 And Moses did as the Lord commanded him; and the assembly was gathered together unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.5 And Moses said unto the congregation, This is the thing which the Lord commanded to be done.6 And Moses brought Aaron and his sons, and washed them with water.7 And he put upon him the coat, and girded him with the girdle, and clothed him with the robe, and put the ephod upon him, and he girded him with the curious girdle of the ephod, and bound it unto him therewith.8 And he put the breastplate upon him: also he put in the breastplate the Urim and the Thummim.9 And he put the mitre upon his head; also upon the mitre, even upon his forefront, did he put the golden plate, the holy crown; as the Lord commanded Moses.10 And Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the tabernacle and all that was therein, and sanctified them.11 And he sprinkled thereof upon the altar seven times, and anointed the altar and all his vessels, both the laver and his foot, to sanctify them.12 And he poured of the anointing oil upon Aaron's head, and anointed him, to sanctify him.13 And Moses brought Aaron's sons, and put coats upon them, and girded them with girdles, and put bonnets upon them; as the Lord commanded Moses.\r\n\r\n14 And he brought the bullock for the sin offering: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the bullock for the sin offering.15 And he slew it; and Moses took the blood, and put it upon the horns of the altar round about with his finger, and purified the altar, and poured the blood at the bottom of the altar, and sanctified it, to make reconciliation upon it.16 And he took all the fat that was upon the inwards, and the caul above the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and Moses burned it upon the altar.17 But the bullock, and his hide, his flesh, and his dung, he burnt with fire without the camp; as the Lord commanded Moses.\r\n\r\n18 And he brought the ram for the burnt offering: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram.19 And he killed it; and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about.20 And he cut the ram into pieces; and Moses burnt the head, and the pieces, and the fat.21 And he washed the inwards and the legs in water; and Moses burnt the whole ram upon the altar: it was a burnt sacrifice for a sweet savour, and an offering made by fire unto the Lord; as the Lord commanded Moses.\r\n\r\n22 And he brought the other ram, the ram of consecration: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram.23 And he slew it; and Moses took of the blood of it, and put it upon the tip of Aaron's right ear, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot.24 And he brought Aaron's sons, and Moses put of the blood upon the tip of their right ear, and upon the thumbs of their right hands, and upon the great toes of their right feet: and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about.25 And he took the fat, and the rump, and all the fat that was upon the inwards, and the caul above the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and the right shoulder:26 And out of the basket of unleavened bread, that was before the Lord, he took one unleavened cake, and a cake of oiled bread, and one wafer, and put them on the fat, and upon the right shoulder:27 And he put all upon Aaron's hands, and upon his sons' hands, and waved them for a wave offering before the Lord.28 And Moses took them from off their hands, and burnt them on the altar upon the burnt offering: they were consecrations for a sweet savour: it is an offering made by fire unto the Lord.29 And Moses took the breast, and waved it for a wave offering before the Lord: for of the ram of consecration it was Moses' part; as the Lord commanded Moses.30 And Moses took of the anointing oil, and of the blood which was upon the altar, and sprinkled it upon Aaron, and upon his garments, and upon his sons, and upon his sons' garments with him; and sanctified Aaron, and his garments, and his sons, and his sons' garments with him.\r\n\r\n31 And Moses said unto Aaron and to his sons, Boil the flesh at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and there eat it with the bread that is in the basket of consecrations, as I commanded, saying, Aaron and his sons shall eat it.32 And that which remaineth of the flesh and of the bread shall ye burn with fire.33 And ye shall not go out of the door of the tabernacle of the congregation in seven days, until the days of your consecration be at an end: for seven days shall he consecrate you.34 As he hath done this day, so the Lord hath commanded to do, to make an atonement for you.35 Therefore shall ye abide at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation day and night seven days, and keep the charge of the Lord, that ye die not: for so I am commanded.36 So Aaron and his sons did all things which the Lord commanded by the hand of Moses.91 And it came to pass on the eighth day, that Moses called Aaron and his sons, and the elders of Israel;2 And he said unto Aaron, Take thee a young calf for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering, without blemish, and offer them before the Lord.3 And unto the children of Israel thou shalt speak, saying, Take ye a kid of the goats for a sin offering; and a calf and a lamb, both of the first year, without blemish, for a burnt offering;4 Also a bullock and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice before the Lord; and a meat offering mingled with oil: for to day the Lord will appear unto you.\r\n\r\n5 And they brought that which Moses commanded before the tabernacle of the congregation: and all the congregation drew near and stood before the Lord.6 And Moses said, This is the thing which the Lord commanded that ye should do: and the glory of the Lord shall appear unto you.7 And Moses said unto Aaron, Go unto the altar, and offer thy sin offering, and thy burnt offering, and make an atonement for thyself, and for the people: and offer the offering of the people, and make an atonement for them; as the Lord commanded.\r\n\r\n8 Aaron therefore went unto the altar, and slew the calf of the sin offering, which was for himself.9 And the sons of Aaron brought the blood unto him: and he dipped his finger in the blood, and put it upon the horns of the altar, and poured out the blood at the bottom of the altar:10 But the fat, and the kidneys, and the caul above the liver of the sin offering, he burnt upon the altar; as the Lord commanded Moses.11 And the flesh and the hide he burnt with fire without the camp.12 And he slew the burnt offering; and Aaron's sons presented unto him the blood, which he sprinkled round about upon the altar.13 And they presented the burnt offering unto him, with the pieces thereof, and the head: and he burnt them upon the altar.14 And he did wash the inwards and the legs, and burnt them upon the burnt offering on the altar.\r\n\r\n15 And he brought the people's offering, and took the goat, which was the sin offering for the people, and slew it, and offered it for sin, as the first.16 And he brought the burnt offering, and offered it according to the manner.17 And he brought the meat offering, and took an handful thereof, and burnt it upon the altar, beside the burnt sacrifice of the morning.18 He slew also the bullock and the ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings, which was for the people: and Aaron's sons presented unto him the blood, which he sprinkled upon the altar round about,19 And the fat of the bullock and of the ram, the rump, and that which covereth the inwards, and the kidneys, and the caul above the liver:20 And they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burnt the fat upon the altar:21 And the breasts and the right shoulder Aaron waved for a wave offering before the Lord; as Moses commanded.22 And Aaron lifted up his hand toward the people, and blessed them, and came down from offering of the sin offering, and the burnt offering, and peace offerings.\r\n\r\n23 And Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of the congregation, and came out, and blessed the people: and the glory of the Lord appeared unto all the people.24 And there came a fire out from before the Lord, and consumed upon the altar the burnt offering and the fat: which when all the people saw, they shouted, and fell on their faces.101 And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took either of them his censer, and put fire therein, and put incense thereon, and offered strange fire before the Lord, which he commanded them not.2 And there went out fire from the Lord, and devoured them, and they died before the Lord.\r\n\r\n3 Then Moses said unto Aaron, This is it that the Lord spake, saying, I will be sanctified in them that come nigh me, and before all the people I will be glorified. And Aaron held his peace.4 And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aaron, and said unto them, Come near, carry your brethren from before the sanctuary out of the camp.5 So they went near, and carried them in their coats out of the camp; as Moses had said.6 And Moses said unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his sons, Uncover not your heads, neither rend your clothes; lest ye die, and lest wrath come upon all the people: but let your brethren, the whole house of Israel, bewail the burning which the Lord hath kindled.7 And ye shall not go out from the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, lest ye die: for the anointing oil of the Lord is upon you. And they did according to the word of Moses.\r\n\r\n8 And the Lord spake unto Aaron, saying,9 Do not drink wine nor strong drink, thou, nor thy sons with thee, when ye go into the tabernacle of the congregation, lest ye die: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations:10 And that ye may put difference between holy and unholy, and between unclean and clean;11 And that ye may teach the children of Israel all the statutes which the Lord hath spoken unto them by the hand of Moses.\r\n\r\n12 And Moses spake unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his sons that were left, Take the meat offering that remaineth of the offerings of the Lord made by fire, and eat it without leaven beside the altar: for it is most holy:13 And ye shall eat it in the holy place, because it is thy due, and thy sons' due, of the sacrifices of the Lord made by fire: for so I am commanded.14 And the wave breast and heave shoulder shall ye eat in a clean place; thou, and thy sons, and thy daughters with thee: for they be thy due, and thy sons' due, which are given out of the sacrifices of peace offerings of the children of Israel.15 The heave shoulder and the wave breast shall they bring with the offerings made by fire of the fat, to wave it for a wave offering before the Lord; and it shall be thine, and thy sons' with thee, by a statute for ever; as the Lord hath commanded.\r\n\r\n16 And Moses diligently sought the goat of the sin offering, and, behold, it was burnt: and he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, the sons of Aaron which were left alive, saying,17 Wherefore have ye not eaten the sin offering in the holy place, seeing it is most holy, and God hath given it you to bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for them before the Lord?18 Behold, the blood of it was not brought in within the holy place: ye should indeed have eaten it in the holy place, as I commanded.19 And Aaron said unto Moses, Behold, this day have they offered their sin offering and their burnt offering before the Lord; and such things have befallen me: and if I had eaten the sin offering to day, should it have been accepted in the sight of the Lord?20 And when Moses heard that, he was content.111 And the Lord spake unto Moses and to Aaron, saying unto them,2 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, These are the beasts which ye shall eat among all the beasts that are on the earth.3 Whatsoever parteth the hoof, and is clovenfooted, and cheweth the cud, among the beasts, that shall ye eat.4 Nevertheless these shall ye not eat of them that chew the cud, or of them that divide the hoof: as the camel, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he is unclean unto you.5 And the coney, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he is unclean unto you.6 And the hare, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he is unclean unto you.7 And the swine, though he divide the hoof, and be clovenfooted, yet he cheweth not the cud; he is unclean to you.8 Of their flesh shall ye not eat, and their carcase shall ye not touch; they are unclean to you.\r\n\r\n9 These shall ye eat of all that are in the waters: whatsoever hath fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers, them shall ye eat.10 And all that have not fins and scales in the seas, and in the rivers, of all that move in the waters, and of any living thing which is in the waters, they shall be an abomination unto you:11 They shall be even an abomination unto you; ye shall not eat of their flesh, but ye shall have their carcases in abomination.12 Whatsoever hath no fins nor scales in the waters, that shall be an abomination unto you.\r\n\r\n13 And these are they which ye shall have in abomination among the fowls; they shall not be eaten, they are an abomination: the eagle, and the ossifrage, and the ospray,14 And the vulture, and the kite after his kind;15 Every raven after his kind;16 And the owl, and the night hawk, and the cuckow, and the hawk after his kind,17 And the little owl, and the cormorant, and the great owl,18 And the swan, and the pelican, and the gier eagle,19 And the stork, the heron after her kind, and the lapwing, and the bat.\r\n\r\n20 All fowls that creep, going upon all four, shall be an abomination unto you.21 Yet these may ye eat of every flying creeping thing that goeth upon all four, which have legs above their feet, to leap withal upon the earth;22 Even these of them ye may eat; the locust after his kind, and the bald locust after his kind, and the beetle after his kind, and the grasshopper after his kind.23 But all other flying creeping things, which have four feet, shall be an abomination unto you.24 And for these ye shall be unclean: whosoever toucheth the carcase of them shall be unclean until the even.25 And whosoever beareth ought of the carcase of them shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even.26 The carcases of every beast which divideth the hoof, and is not clovenfooted, nor cheweth the cud, are unclean unto you: every one that toucheth them shall be unclean.27 And whatsoever goeth upon his paws, among all manner of beasts that go on all four, those are unclean unto you: whoso toucheth their carcase shall be unclean until the even.28 And he that beareth the carcase of them shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: they are unclean unto you.\r\n\r\n29 These also shall be unclean unto you among the creeping things that creep upon the earth; the weasel, and the mouse, and the tortoise after his kind,30 And the ferret, and the chameleon, and the lizard, and the snail, and the mole.31 These are unclean to you among all that creep: whosoever doth touch them, when they be dead, shall be unclean until the even.32 And upon whatsoever any of them, when they are dead, doth fall, it shall be unclean; whether it be any vessel of wood, or raiment, or skin, or sack, whatsoever vessel it be, wherein any work is done, it must be put into water, and it shall be unclean until the even; so it shall be cleansed.33 And every earthen vessel, whereinto any of them falleth, whatsoever is in it shall be unclean; and ye shall break it.34 Of all meat which may be eaten, that on which such water cometh shall be unclean: and all drink that may be drunk in every such vessel shall be unclean.35 And every thing whereupon any part of their carcase falleth shall be unclean; whether it be oven, or ranges for pots, they shall be broken down: for they are unclean, and shall be unclean unto you.36 Nevertheless a fountain or pit, wherein there is plenty of water, shall be clean: but that which toucheth their carcase shall be unclean.37 And if any part of their carcase fall upon any sowing seed which is to be sown, it shall be clean.38 But if any water be put upon the seed, and any part of their carcase fall thereon, it shall be unclean unto you.39 And if any beast, of which ye may eat, die; he that toucheth the carcase thereof shall be unclean until the even.40 And he that eateth of the carcase of it shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: he also that beareth the carcase of it shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even.41 And every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth shall be an abomination; it shall not be eaten.42 Whatsoever goeth upon the belly, and whatsoever goeth upon all four, or whatsoever hath more feet among all creeping things that creep upon the earth, them ye shall not eat; for they are an abomination.\r\n\r\n43 Ye shall not make yourselves abominable with any creeping thing that creepeth, neither shall ye make yourselves unclean with them, that ye should be defiled thereby.44 For I am the Lord your God: ye shall therefore sanctify yourselves, and ye shall be holy; for I am holy: neither shall ye defile yourselves with any manner of creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.45 For I am the Lord that bringeth you up out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: ye shall therefore be holy, for I am holy.46 This is the law of the beasts, and of the fowl, and of every living creature that moveth in the waters, and of every creature that creepeth upon the earth:47 To make a difference between the unclean and the clean, and between the beast that may be eaten and the beast that may not be eaten.121 And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,2 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a woman have conceived seed, and born a man child: then she shall be unclean seven days; according to the days of the separation for her infirmity shall she be unclean.3 And in the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised.4 And she shall then continue in the blood of her purifying three and thirty days; she shall touch no hallowed thing, nor come into the sanctuary, until the days of her purifying be fulfilled.5 But if she bear a maid child, then she shall be unclean two weeks, as in her separation: and she shall continue in the blood of her purifying threescore and six days.\r\n\r\n6 And when the days of her purifying are fulfilled, for a son, or for a daughter, she shall bring a lamb of the first year for a burnt offering, and a young pigeon, or a turtledove, for a sin offering, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, unto the priest:7 Who shall offer it before the Lord, and make an atonement for her; and she shall be cleansed from the issue of her blood. This is the law for her that hath born a male or a female.8 And if she be not able to bring a lamb, then she shall bring two turtles, or two young pigeons; the one for the burnt offering, and the other for a sin offering: and the priest shall make an atonement for her, and she shall be clean.131 And the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron, saying,2 When a man shall have in the skin of his flesh a rising, a scab, or bright spot, and it be in the skin of his flesh like the plague of leprosy; then he shall be brought unto Aaron the priest, or unto one of his sons the priests:3 And the priest shall look on the plague in the skin of the flesh: and when the hair in the plague is turned white, and the plague in sight be deeper than the skin of his flesh, it is a plague of leprosy: and the priest shall look on him, and pronounce him unclean.4 If the bright spot be white in the skin of his flesh, and in sight be not deeper than the skin, and the hair thereof be not turned white; then the priest shall shut up him that hath the plague seven days:5 And the priest shall look on him the seventh day: and, behold, if the plague in his sight be at a stay, and the plague spread not in the skin; then the priest shall shut him up seven days more:6 And the priest shall look on him again the seventh day: and, behold, if the plague be somewhat dark, and the plague spread not in the skin, the priest shall pronounce him clean: it is but a scab: and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean.7 But if the scab spread much abroad in the skin, after that he hath been seen of the priest for his cleansing, he shall be seen of the priest again:8 And if the priest see that, behold, the scab spreadeth in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a leprosy.\r\n\r\n9 When the plague of leprosy is in a man, then he shall be brought unto the priest;10 And the priest shall see him: and, behold, if the rising be white in the skin, and it have turned the hair white, and there be quick raw flesh in the rising;11 It is an old leprosy in the skin of his flesh, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean, and shall not shut him up: for he is unclean.12 And if a leprosy break out abroad in the skin, and the leprosy cover all the skin of him that hath the plague from his head even to his foot, wheresoever the priest looketh;13 Then the priest shall consider: and, behold, if the leprosy have covered all his flesh, he shall pronounce him clean that hath the plague: it is all turned white: he is clean.14 But when raw flesh appeareth in him, he shall be unclean.15 And the priest shall see the raw flesh, and pronounce him to be unclean: for the raw flesh is unclean: it is a leprosy.16 Or if the raw flesh turn again, and be changed unto white, he shall come unto the priest;17 And the priest shall see him: and, behold, if the plague be turned into white; then the priest shall pronounce him clean that hath the plague: he is clean.\r\n\r\n18 The flesh also, in which, even in the skin thereof, was a boil, and is healed,19 And in the place of the boil there be a white rising, or a bright spot, white, and somewhat reddish, and it be shewed to the priest;20 And if, when the priest seeth it, behold, it be in sight lower than the skin, and the hair thereof be turned white; the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a plague of leprosy broken out of the boil.21 But if the priest look on it, and, behold, there be no white hairs therein, and if it be not lower than the skin, but be somewhat dark; then the priest shall shut him up seven days:22 And if it spread much abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a plague.23 But if the bright spot stay in his place, and spread not, it is a burning boil; and the priest shall pronounce him clean.\r\n\r\n24 Or if there be any flesh, in the skin whereof there is a hot burning, and the quick flesh that burneth have a white bright spot, somewhat reddish, or white;25 Then the priest shall look upon it: and, behold, if the hair in the bright spot be turned white, and it be in sight deeper than the skin; it is a leprosy broken out of the burning: wherefore the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is the plague of leprosy.26 But if the priest look on it, and, behold, there be no white hair in the bright spot, and it be no lower than the other skin, but be somewhat dark; then the priest shall shut him up seven days:27 And the priest shall look upon him the seventh day: and if it be spread much abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is the plague of leprosy.28 And if the bright spot stay in his place, and spread not in the skin, but it be somewhat dark; it is a rising of the burning, and the priest shall pronounce him clean: for it is an inflammation of the burning.\r\n\r\n29 If a man or woman have a plague upon the head or the beard;30 Then the priest shall see the plague: and, behold, if it be in sight deeper than the skin; and there be in it a yellow thin hair; then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a dry scall, even a leprosy upon the head or beard.31 And if the priest look on the plague of the scall, and, behold, it be not in sight deeper than the skin, and that there is no black hair in it; then the priest shall shut up him that hath the plague of the scall seven days:32 And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the plague: and, behold, if the scall spread not, and there be in it no yellow hair, and the scall be not in sight deeper than the skin;33 He shall be shaven, but the scall shall he not shave; and the priest shall shut up him that hath the scall seven days more:34 And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the scall: and, behold, if the scall be not spread in the skin, nor be in sight deeper than the skin; then the priest shall pronounce him clean: and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean.35 But if the scall spread much in the skin after his cleansing;36 Then the priest shall look on him: and, behold, if the scall be spread in the skin, the priest shall not seek for yellow hair; he is unclean.37 But if the scall be in his sight at a stay, and that there is black hair grown up therein; the scall is healed, he is clean: and the priest shall pronounce him clean.\r\n\r\n38 If a man also or a woman have in the skin of their flesh bright spots, even white bright spots;39 Then the priest shall look: and, behold, if the bright spots in the skin of their flesh be darkish white; it is a freckled spot that groweth in the skin; he is clean.40 And the man whose hair is fallen off his head, he is bald; yet is he clean.41 And he that hath his hair fallen off from the part of his head toward his face, he is forehead bald: yet is he clean.42 And if there be in the bald head, or bald forehead, a white reddish sore; it is a leprosy sprung up in his bald head, or his bald forehead.43 Then the priest shall look upon it: and, behold, if the rising of the sore be white reddish in his bald head, or in his bald forehead, as the leprosy appeareth in the skin of the flesh;44 He is a leprous man, he is unclean: the priest shall pronounce him utterly unclean; his plague is in his head.45 And the leper in whom the plague is, his clothes shall be rent, and his head bare, and he shall put a covering upon his upper lip, and shall cry, Unclean, unclean.46 All the days wherein the plague shall be in him he shall be defiled; he is unclean: he shall dwell alone; without the camp shall his habitation be.\r\n\r\n47 The garment also that the plague of leprosy is in, whether it be a woollen garment, or a linen garment;48 Whether it be in the warp, or woof; of linen, or of woollen; whether in a skin, or in any thing made of skin;49 And if the plague be greenish or reddish in the garment, or in the skin, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin; it is a plague of leprosy, and shall be shewed unto the priest:50 And the priest shall look upon the plague, and shut up it that hath the plague seven days:51 And he shall look on the plague on the seventh day: if the plague be spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in a skin, or in any work that is made of skin; the plague is a fretting leprosy; it is unclean.52 He shall therefore burn that garment, whether warp or woof, in woollen or in linen, or any thing of skin, wherein the plague is: for it is a fretting leprosy; it shall be burnt in the fire.53 And if the priest shall look, and, behold, the plague be not spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin;54 Then the priest shall command that they wash the thing wherein the plague is, and he shall shut it up seven days more:55 And the priest shall look on the plague, after that it is washed: and, behold, if the plague have not changed his colour, and the plague be not spread; it is unclean; thou shalt burn it in the fire; it is fret inward, whether it be bare within or without.56 And if the priest look, and, behold, the plague be somewhat dark after the washing of it; then he shall rend it out of the garment, or out of the skin, or out of the warp, or out of the woof:57 And if it appear still in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin; it is a spreading plague: thou shalt burn that wherein the plague is with fire.58 And the garment, either warp, or woof, or whatsoever thing of skin it be, which thou shalt wash, if the plague be departed from them, then it shall be washed the second time, and shall be clean.59 This is the law of the plague of leprosy in a garment of woollen or linen, either in the warp, or woof, or any thing of skins, to pronounce it clean, or to pronounce it unclean.141 And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,2 This shall be the law of the leper in the day of his cleansing: He shall be brought unto the priest:3 And the priest shall go forth out of the camp; and the priest shall look, and, behold, if the plague of leprosy be healed in the leper;4 Then shall the priest command to take for him that is to be cleansed two birds alive and clean, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop:5 And the priest shall command that one of the birds be killed in an earthen vessel over running water:6 As for the living bird, he shall take it, and the cedar wood, and the scarlet, and the hyssop, and shall dip them and the living bird in the blood of the bird that was killed over the running water:7 And he shall sprinkle upon him that is to be cleansed from the leprosy seven times, and shall pronounce him clean, and shall let the living bird loose into the open field.8 And he that is to be cleansed shall wash his clothes, and shave off all his hair, and wash himself in water, that he may be clean: and after that he shall come into the camp, and shall tarry abroad out of his tent seven days.9 But it shall be on the seventh day, that he shall shave all his hair off his head and his beard and his eyebrows, even all his hair he shall shave off: and he shall wash his clothes, also he shall wash his flesh in water, and he shall be clean.\r\n\r\n10 And on the eighth day he shall take two he lambs without blemish, and one ewe lamb of the first year without blemish, and three tenth deals of fine flour for a meat offering, mingled with oil, and one log of oil.11 And the priest that maketh him clean shall present the man that is to be made clean, and those things, before the Lord, at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation:12 And the priest shall take one he lamb, and offer him for a trespass offering, and the log of oil, and wave them for a wave offering before the Lord:13 And he shall slay the lamb in the place where he shall kill the sin offering and the burnt offering, in the holy place: for as the sin offering is the priest's, so is the trespass offering: it is most holy:14 And the priest shall take some of the blood of the trespass offering, and the priest shall put it upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot:15 And the priest shall take some of the log of oil, and pour it into the palm of his own left hand:16 And the priest shall dip his right finger in the oil that is in his left hand, and shall sprinkle of the oil with his finger seven times before the Lord:17 And of the rest of the oil that is in his hand shall the priest put upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot, upon the blood of the trespass offering:18 And the remnant of the oil that is in the priest's hand he shall pour upon the head of him that is to be cleansed: and the priest shall make an atonement for him before the Lord.19 And the priest shall offer the sin offering, and make an atonement for him that is to be cleansed from his uncleanness; and afterward he shall kill the burnt offering:20 And the priest shall offer the burnt offering and the meat offering upon the altar: and the priest shall make an atonement for him, and he shall be clean.\r\n\r\n21 And if he be poor, and cannot get so much; then he shall take one lamb for a trespass offering to be waved, to make an atonement for him, and one tenth deal of fine flour mingled with oil for a meat offering, and a log of oil;22 And two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, such as he is able to get; and the one shall be a sin offering, and the other a burnt offering.23 And he shall bring them on the eighth day for his cleansing unto the priest, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, before the Lord.24 And the priest shall take the lamb of the trespass offering, and the log of oil, and the priest shall wave them for a wave offering before the Lord:25 And he shall kill the lamb of the trespass offering, and the priest shall take some of the blood of the trespass offering, and put it upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot:26 And the priest shall pour of the oil into the palm of his own left hand:27 And the priest shall sprinkle with his right finger some of the oil that is in his left hand seven times before the Lord:28 And the priest shall put of the oil that is in his hand upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot, upon the place of the blood of the trespass offering:29 And the rest of the oil that is in the priest's hand he shall put upon the head of him that is to be cleansed, to make an atonement for him before the Lord.30 And he shall offer the one of the turtledoves, or of the young pigeons, such as he can get;31 Even such as he is able to get, the one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering, with the meat offering: and the priest shall make an atonement for him that is to be cleansed before the Lord.32 This is the law of him in whom is the plague of leprosy, whose hand is not able to get that which pertaineth to his cleansing.\r\n\r\n33 And the Lord spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,34 When ye be come into the land of Canaan, which I give to you for a possession, and I put the plague of leprosy in a house of the land of your possession;35 And he that owneth the house shall come and tell the priest, saying, It seemeth to me there is as it were a plague in the house:36 Then the priest shall command that they empty the house, before the priest go into it to see the plague, that all that is in the house be not made unclean: and afterward the priest shall go in to see the house:37 And he shall look on the plague, and, behold, if the plague be in the walls of the house with hollow strakes, greenish or reddish, which in sight are lower than the wall;38 Then the priest shall go out of the house to the door of the house, and shut up the house seven days:39 And the priest shall come again the seventh day, and shall look: and, behold, if the plague be spread in the walls of the house;40 Then the priest shall command that they take away the stones in which the plague is, and they shall cast them into an unclean place without the city:41 And he shall cause the house to be scraped within round about, and they shall pour out the dust that they scrape off without the city into an unclean place:42 And they shall take other stones, and put them in the place of those stones; and he shall take other morter, and shall plaister the house.43 And if the plague come again, and break out in the house, after that he hath taken away the stones, and after he hath scraped the house, and after it is plaistered;44 Then the priest shall come and look, and, behold, if the plague be spread in the house, it is a fretting leprosy in the house: it is unclean.45 And he shall break down the house, the stones of it, and the timber thereof, and all the morter of the house; and he shall carry them forth out of the city into an unclean place.46 Moreover he that goeth into the house all the while that it is shut up shall be unclean until the even.47 And he that lieth in the house shall wash his clothes; and he that eateth in the house shall wash his clothes.48 And if the priest shall come in, and look upon it, and, behold, the plague hath not spread in the house, after the house was plaistered: then the priest shall pronounce the house clean, because the plague is healed.49 And he shall take to cleanse the house two birds, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop:50 And he shall kill the one of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water:51 And he shall take the cedar wood, and the hyssop, and the scarlet, and the living bird, and dip them in the blood of the slain bird, and in the running water, and sprinkle the house seven times:52 And he shall cleanse the house with the blood of the bird, and with the running water, and with the living bird, and with the cedar wood, and with the hyssop, and with the scarlet:53 But he shall let go the living bird out of the city into the open fields, and make an atonement for the house: and it shall be clean.\r\n\r\n54 This is the law for all manner of plague of leprosy, and scall,55 And for the leprosy of a garment, and of a house,56 And for a rising, and for a scab, and for a bright spot:57 To teach when it is unclean, and when it is clean: this is the law of leprosy.151 And the Lord spake unto Moses and to Aaron, saying,2 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When any man hath a running issue out of his flesh, because of his issue he is unclean.3 And this shall be his uncleanness in his issue: whether his flesh run with his issue, or his flesh be stopped from his issue, it is his uncleanness.4 Every bed, whereon he lieth that hath the issue, is unclean: and every thing, whereon he sitteth, shall be unclean.5 And whosoever toucheth his bed shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.6 And he that sitteth on any thing whereon he sat that hath the issue shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.7 And he that toucheth the flesh of him that hath the issue shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.8 And if he that hath the issue spit upon him that is clean; then he shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.9 And what saddle soever he rideth upon that hath the issue shall be unclean.10 And whosoever toucheth any thing that was under him shall be unclean until the even: and he that beareth any of those things shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.11 And whomsoever he toucheth that hath the issue, and hath not rinsed his hands in water, he shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.12 And the vessel of earth, that he toucheth which hath the issue, shall be broken: and every vessel of wood shall be rinsed in water.13 And when he that hath an issue is cleansed of his issue; then he shall number to himself seven days for his cleansing, and wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in running water, and shall be clean.14 And on the eighth day he shall take to him two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, and come before the Lord unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and give them unto the priest:15 And the priest shall offer them, the one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering; and the priest shall make an atonement for him before the Lord for his issue.16 And if any man's seed of copulation go out from him, then he shall wash all his flesh in water, and be unclean until the even.17 And every garment, and every skin, whereon is the seed of copulation, shall be washed with water, and be unclean until the even.18 The woman also with whom man shall lie with seed of copulation, they shall both bathe themselves in water, and be unclean until the even.\r\n\r\n19 And if a woman have an issue, and her issue in her flesh be blood, she shall be put apart seven days: and whosoever toucheth her shall be unclean until the even.20 And every thing that she lieth upon in her separation shall be unclean: every thing also that she sitteth upon shall be unclean.21 And whosoever toucheth her bed shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.22 And whosoever toucheth any thing that she sat upon shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.23 And if it be on her bed, or on any thing whereon she sitteth, when he toucheth it, he shall be unclean until the even.24 And if any man lie with her at all, and her flowers be upon him, he shall be unclean seven days; and all the bed whereon he lieth shall be unclean.25 And if a woman have an issue of her blood many days out of the time of her separation, or if it run beyond the time of her separation; all the days of the issue of her uncleanness shall be as the days of her separation: she shall be unclean.26 Every bed whereon she lieth all the days of her issue shall be unto her as the bed of her separation: and whatsoever she sitteth upon shall be unclean, as the uncleanness of her separation.27 And whosoever toucheth those things shall be unclean, and shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.28 But if she be cleansed of her issue, then she shall number to herself seven days, and after that she shall be clean.29 And on the eighth day she shall take unto her two turtles, or two young pigeons, and bring them unto the priest, to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.30 And the priest shall offer the one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering; and the priest shall make an atonement for her before the Lord for the issue of her uncleanness.31 Thus shall ye separate the children of Israel from their uncleanness; that they die not in their uncleanness, when they defile my tabernacle that is among them.32 This is the law of him that hath an issue, and of him whose seed goeth from him, and is defiled therewith;33 And of her that is sick of her flowers, and of him that hath an issue, of the man, and of the woman, and of him that lieth with her that is unclean.161 And the Lord spake unto Moses after the death of the two sons of Aaron, when they offered before the Lord, and died;2 And the Lord said unto Moses, Speak unto Aaron thy brother, that he come not at all times into the holy place within the vail before the mercy seat, which is upon the ark; that he die not: for I will appear in the cloud upon the mercy seat.3 Thus shall Aaron come into the holy place: with a young bullock for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering.4 He shall put on the holy linen coat, and he shall have the linen breeches upon his flesh, and shall be girded with a linen girdle, and with the linen mitre shall he be attired: these are holy garments; therefore shall he wash his flesh in water, and so put them on.\r\n\r\n5 And he shall take of the congregation of the children of Israel two kids of the goats for a sin offering, and one ram for a burnt offering.6 And Aaron shall offer his bullock of the sin offering, which is for himself, and make an atonement for himself, and for his house.7 And he shall take the two goats, and present them before the Lord at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.8 And Aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats; one lot for the Lord, and the other lot for the scapegoat.9 And Aaron shall bring the goat upon which the Lord's lot fell, and offer him for a sin offering.10 But the goat, on which the lot fell to be the scapegoat, shall be presented alive before the Lord, to make an atonement with him, and to let him go for a scapegoat into the wilderness.11 And Aaron shall bring the bullock of the sin offering, which is for himself, and shall make an atonement for himself, and for his house, and shall kill the bullock of the sin offering which is for himself:12 And he shall take a censer full of burning coals of fire from off the altar before the Lord, and his hands full of sweet incense beaten small, and bring it within the vail:13 And he shall put the incense upon the fire before the Lord, that the cloud of the incense may cover the mercy seat that is upon the testimony, that he die not:14 And he shall take of the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it with his finger upon the mercy seat eastward; and before the mercy seat shall he sprinkle of the blood with his finger seven times.\r\n\r\n15 Then shall he kill the goat of the sin offering, that is for the people, and bring his blood within the vail, and do with that blood as he did with the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it upon the mercy seat, and before the mercy seat:16 And he shall make an atonement for the holy place, because of the uncleanness of the children of Israel, and because of their transgressions in all their sins: and so shall he do for the tabernacle of the congregation, that remaineth among them in the midst of their uncleanness.17 And there shall be no man in the tabernacle of the congregation when he goeth in to make an atonement in the holy place, until he come out, and have made an atonement for himself, and for his household, and for all the congregation of Israel.18 And he shall go out unto the altar that is before the Lord, and make an atonement for it; and shall take of the blood of the bullock, and of the blood of the goat, and put it upon the horns of the altar round about.19 And he shall sprinkle of the blood upon it with his finger seven times, and cleanse it, and hallow it from the uncleanness of the children of Israel.\r\n\r\n20 And when he hath made an end of reconciling the holy place, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and the altar, he shall bring the live goat:21 And Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of the live goat, and confess over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and all their transgressions in all their sins, putting them upon the head of the goat, and shall send him away by the hand of a fit man into the wilderness:22 And the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities unto a land not inhabited: and he shall let go the goat in the wilderness.23 And Aaron shall come into the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall put off the linen garments, which he put on when he went into the holy place, and shall leave them there:24 And he shall wash his flesh with water in the holy place, and put on his garments, and come forth, and offer his burnt offering, and the burnt offering of the people, and make an atonement for himself, and for the people.25 And the fat of the sin offering shall he burn upon the altar.26 And he that let go the goat for the scapegoat shall wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward come into the camp.27 And the bullock for the sin offering, and the goat for the sin offering, whose blood was brought in to make atonement in the holy place, shall one carry forth without the camp; and they shall burn in the fire their skins, and their flesh, and their dung.28 And he that burneth them shall wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp.\r\n\r\n29 And this shall be a statute for ever unto you: that in the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month, ye shall afflict your souls, and do no work at all, whether it be one of your own country, or a stranger that sojourneth among you:30 For on that day shall the priest make an atonement for you, to cleanse you, that ye may be clean from all your sins before the Lord.31 It shall be a sabbath of rest unto you, and ye shall afflict your souls, by a statute for ever.32 And the priest, whom he shall anoint, and whom he shall consecrate to minister in the priest's office in his father's stead, shall make the atonement, and shall put on the linen clothes, even the holy garments:33 And he shall make an atonement for the holy sanctuary, and he shall make an atonement for the tabernacle of the congregation, and for the altar, and he shall make an atonement for the priests, and for all the people of the congregation.34 And this shall be an everlasting statute unto you, to make an atonement for the children of Israel for all their sins once a year. And he did as the Lord commanded Moses.171 And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,2 Speak unto Aaron, and unto his sons, and unto all the children of Israel, and say unto them; This is the thing which the Lord hath commanded, saying,3 What man soever there be of the house of Israel, that killeth an ox, or lamb, or goat, in the camp, or that killeth it out of the camp,4 And bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, to offer an offering unto the Lord before the tabernacle of the Lord; blood shall be imputed unto that man; he hath shed blood; and that man shall be cut off from among his people:5 To the end that the children of Israel may bring their sacrifices, which they offer in the open field, even that they may bring them unto the Lord, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, unto the priest, and offer them for peace offerings unto the Lord.6 And the priest shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar of the Lord at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and burn the fat for a sweet savour unto the Lord.7 And they shall no more offer their sacrifices unto devils, after whom they have gone a whoring. This shall be a statute for ever unto them throughout their generations.\r\n\r\n8 And thou shalt say unto them, Whatsoever man there be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers which sojourn among you, that offereth a burnt offering or sacrifice,9 And bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, to offer it unto the Lord; even that man shall be cut off from among his people.\r\n\r\n10 And whatsoever man there be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among you, that eateth any manner of blood; I will even set my face against that soul that eateth blood, and will cut him off from among his people.11 For the life of the flesh is in the blood: and I have given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls: for it is the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul.12 Therefore I said unto the children of Israel, No soul of you shall eat blood, neither shall any stranger that sojourneth among you eat blood.13 And whatsoever man there be of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among you, which hunteth and catcheth any beast or fowl that may be eaten; he shall even pour out the blood thereof, and cover it with dust.14 For it is the life of all flesh; the blood of it is for the life thereof: therefore I said unto the children of Israel, Ye shall eat the blood of no manner of flesh: for the life of all flesh is the blood thereof: whosoever eateth it shall be cut off.15 And every soul that eateth that which died of itself, or that which was torn with beasts, whether it be one of your own country, or a stranger, he shall both wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even: then shall he be clean.16 But if he wash them not, nor bathe his flesh; then he shall bear his iniquity.181 And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,2 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, I am the Lord your God.3 After the doings of the land of Egypt, wherein ye dwelt, shall ye not do: and after the doings of the land of Canaan, whither I bring you, shall ye not do: neither shall ye walk in their ordinances.4 Ye shall do my judgments, and keep mine ordinances, to walk therein: I am the Lord your God.5 Ye shall therefore keep my statutes, and my judgments: which if a man do, he shall live in them: I am the Lord.\r\n\r\n6 None of you shall approach to any that is near of kin to him, to uncover their nakedness: I am the Lord.7 The nakedness of thy father, or the nakedness of thy mother, shalt thou not uncover: she is thy mother; thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.8 The nakedness of thy father's wife shalt thou not uncover: it is thy father's nakedness.9 The nakedness of thy sister, the daughter of thy father, or daughter of thy mother, whether she be born at home, or born abroad, even their nakedness thou shalt not uncover.10 The nakedness of thy son's daughter, or of thy daughter's daughter, even their nakedness thou shalt not uncover: for theirs is thine own nakedness.11 The nakedness of thy father's wife's daughter, begotten of thy father, she is thy sister, thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.12 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father's sister: she is thy father's near kinswoman.13 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother's sister: for she is thy mother's near kinswoman.14 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father's brother, thou shalt not approach to his wife: she is thine aunt.15 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy daughter in law: she is thy son's wife; thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.16 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy brother's wife: it is thy brother's nakedness.17 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her daughter, neither shalt thou take her son's daughter, or her daughter's daughter, to uncover her nakedness; for they are her near kinswomen: it is wickedness.18 Neither shalt thou take a wife to her sister, to vex her, to uncover her nakedness, beside the other in her life time.\r\n\r\n19 Also thou shalt not approach unto a woman to uncover her nakedness, as long as she is put apart for her uncleanness.20 Moreover thou shalt not lie carnally with thy neighbour's wife, to defile thyself with her.21 And thou shalt not let any of thy seed pass through the fire to Molech, neither shalt thou profane the name of thy God: I am the Lord.22 Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is abomination.23 Neither shalt thou lie with any beast to defile thyself therewith: neither shall any woman stand before a beast to lie down thereto: it is confusion.24 Defile not ye yourselves in any of these things: for in all these the nations are defiled which I cast out before you:25 And the land is defiled: therefore I do visit the iniquity thereof upon it, and the land itself vomiteth out her inhabitants.26 Ye shall therefore keep my statutes and my judgments, and shall not commit any of these abominations; neither any of your own nation, nor any stranger that sojourneth among you:27 (For all these abominations have the men of the land done, which were before you, and the land is defiled;)28 That the land spue not you out also, when ye defile it, as it spued out the nations that were before you.29 For whosoever shall commit any of these abominations, even the souls that commit them shall be cut off from among their people.30 Therefore shall ye keep mine ordinance, that ye commit not any one of these abominable customs, which were committed before you, and that ye defile not yourselves therein: I am the Lord your God.191 And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,2 Speak unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, and say unto them, Ye shall be holy: for I the Lord your God am holy.\r\n\r\n3 Ye shall fear every man his mother, and his father, and keep my sabbaths: I am the Lord your God.\r\n\r\n4 Turn ye not unto idols, nor make to yourselves molten gods: I am the Lord your God.\r\n\r\n5 And if ye offer a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the Lord, ye shall offer it at your own will.6 It shall be eaten the same day ye offer it, and on the morrow: and if ought remain until the third day, it shall be burnt in the fire.7 And if it be eaten at all on the third day, it is abominable; it shall not be accepted.8 Therefore every one that eateth it shall bear his iniquity, because he hath profaned the hallowed thing of the Lord: and that soul shall be cut off from among his people.\r\n\r\n9 And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not wholly reap the corners of thy field, neither shalt thou gather the gleanings of thy harvest.10 And thou shalt not glean thy vineyard, neither shalt thou gather every grape of thy vineyard; thou shalt leave them for the poor and stranger: I am the Lord your God.\r\n\r\n11 Ye shall not steal, neither deal falsely, neither lie one to another.\r\n\r\n12 And ye shall not swear by my name falsely, neither shalt thou profane the name of thy God: I am the Lord.\r\n\r\n13 Thou shalt not defraud thy neighbour, neither rob him: the wages of him that is hired shall not abide with thee all night until the morning.\r\n\r\n14 Thou shalt not curse the deaf, nor put a stumblingblock before the blind, but shalt fear thy God: I am the Lord.\r\n\r\n15 Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment: thou shalt not respect the person of the poor, nor honour the person of the mighty: but in righteousness shalt thou judge thy neighbour.\r\n\r\n16 Thou shalt not go up and down as a talebearer among thy people: neither shalt thou stand against the blood of thy neighbour: I am the Lord.\r\n\r\n17 Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thine heart: thou shalt in any wise rebuke thy neighbour, and not suffer sin upon him.\r\n\r\n18 Thou shalt not avenge, nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people, but thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself: I am the Lord.\r\n\r\n19 Ye shall keep my statutes. Thou shalt not let thy cattle gender with a diverse kind: thou shalt not sow thy field with mingled seed: neither shall a garment mingled of linen and woollen come upon thee.\r\n\r\n20 And whosoever lieth carnally with a woman, that is a bondmaid, betrothed to an husband, and not at all redeemed, nor freedom given her; she shall be scourged; they shall not be put to death, because she was not free.21 And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the Lord, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, even a ram for a trespass offering.22 And the priest shall make an atonement for him with the ram of the trespass offering before the Lord for his sin which he hath done: and the sin which he hath done shall be forgiven him.\r\n\r\n23 And when ye shall come into the land, and shall have planted all manner of trees for food, then ye shall count the fruit thereof as uncircumcised: three years shall it be as uncircumcised unto you: it shall not be eaten of.24 But in the fourth year all the fruit thereof shall be holy to praise the Lord withal.25 And in the fifth year shall ye eat of the fruit thereof, that it may yield unto you the increase thereof: I am the Lord your God.\r\n\r\n26 Ye shall not eat any thing with the blood: neither shall ye use enchantment, nor observe times.27 Ye shall not round the corners of your heads, neither shalt thou mar the corners of thy beard.28 Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, nor print any marks upon you: I am the Lord.\r\n\r\n29 Do not prostitute thy daughter, to cause her to be a whore; lest the land fall to whoredom, and the land become full of wickedness.\r\n\r\n30 Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I am the Lord.\r\n\r\n31 Regard not them that have familiar spirits, neither seek after wizards, to be defiled by them: I am the Lord your God.\r\n\r\n32 Thou shalt rise up before the hoary head, and honour the face of the old man, and fear thy God: I am the Lord.\r\n\r\n33 And if a stranger sojourn with thee in your land, ye shall not vex him.34 But the stranger that dwelleth with you shall be unto you as one born among you, and thou shalt love him as thyself; for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt: I am the Lord your God.\r\n\r\n35 Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, in meteyard, in weight, or in measure.36 Just balances, just weights, a just ephah, and a just hin, shall ye have: I am the Lord your God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt.37 Therefore shall ye observe all my statutes, and all my judgments, and do them: I am the Lord.201 And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,2 Again, thou shalt say to the children of Israel, Whosoever he be of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn in Israel, that giveth any of his seed unto Molech; he shall surely be put to death: the people of the land shall stone him with stones.3 And I will set my face against that man, and will cut him off from among his people; because he hath given of his seed unto Molech, to defile my sanctuary, and to profane my holy name.4 And if the people of the land do any ways hide their eyes from the man, when he giveth of his seed unto Molech, and kill him not:5 Then I will set my face against that man, and against his family, and will cut him off, and all that go a whoring after him, to commit whoredom with Molech, from among their people.\r\n\r\n6 And the soul that turneth after such as have familiar spirits, and after wizards, to go a whoring after them, I will even set my face against that soul, and will cut him off from among his people.\r\n\r\n7 Sanctify yourselves therefore, and be ye holy: for I am the Lord your God.8 And ye shall keep my statutes, and do them: I am the Lord which sanctify you.\r\n\r\n9 For every one that curseth his father or his mother shall be surely put to death: he hath cursed his father or his mother; his blood shall be upon him.\r\n\r\n10 And the man that committeth adultery with another man's wife, even he that committeth adultery with his neighbour's wife, the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death.11 And the man that lieth with his father's wife hath uncovered his father's nakedness: both of them shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.12 And if a man lie with his daughter in law, both of them shall surely be put to death: they have wrought confusion; their blood shall be upon them.13 If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.14 And if a man take a wife and her mother, it is wickedness: they shall be burnt with fire, both he and they; that there be no wickedness among you.15 And if a man lie with a beast, he shall surely be put to death: and ye shall slay the beast.16 And if a woman approach unto any beast, and lie down thereto, thou shalt kill the woman, and the beast: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.17 And if a man shall take his sister, his father's daughter, or his mother's daughter, and see her nakedness, and she see his nakedness; it is a wicked thing; and they shall be cut off in the sight of their people: he hath uncovered his sister's nakedness; he shall bear his iniquity.18 And if a man shall lie with a woman having her sickness, and shall uncover her nakedness; he hath discovered her fountain, and she hath uncovered the fountain of her blood: and both of them shall be cut off from among their people.19 And thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother's sister, nor of thy father's sister: for he uncovereth his near kin: they shall bear their iniquity.20 And if a man shall lie with his uncle's wife, he hath uncovered his uncle's nakedness: they shall bear their sin; they shall die childless.21 And if a man shall take his brother's wife, it is an unclean thing: he hath uncovered his brother's nakedness; they shall be childless.\r\n\r\n22 Ye shall therefore keep all my statutes, and all my judgments, and do them: that the land, whither I bring you to dwell therein, spue you not out.23 And ye shall not walk in the manners of the nation, which I cast out before you: for they committed all these things, and therefore I abhorred them.24 But I have said unto you, Ye shall inherit their land, and I will give it unto you to possess it, a land that floweth with milk and honey: I am the Lord your God, which have separated you from other people.25 Ye shall therefore put difference between clean beasts and unclean, and between unclean fowls and clean: and ye shall not make your souls abominable by beast, or by fowl, or by any manner of living thing that creepeth on the ground, which I have separated from you as unclean.26 And ye shall be holy unto me: for I the Lord am holy, and have severed you from other people, that ye should be mine.\r\n\r\n27 A man also or woman that hath a familiar spirit, or that is a wizard, shall surely be put to death: they shall stone them with stones: their blood shall be upon them.211 And the Lord said unto Moses, Speak unto the priests the sons of Aaron, and say unto them, There shall none be defiled for the dead among his people:2 But for his kin, that is near unto him, that is, for his mother, and for his father, and for his son, and for his daughter, and for his brother,3 And for his sister a virgin, that is nigh unto him, which hath had no husband; for her may he be defiled.4 But he shall not defile himself, being a chief man among his people, to profane himself.5 They shall not make baldness upon their head, neither shall they shave off the corner of their beard, nor make any cuttings in their flesh.6 They shall be holy unto their God, and not profane the name of their God: for the offerings of the Lord made by fire, and the bread of their God, they do offer: therefore they shall be holy.7 They shall not take a wife that is a whore, or profane; neither shall they take a woman put away from her husband: for he is holy unto his God.8 Thou shalt sanctify him therefore; for he offereth the bread of thy God: he shall be holy unto thee: for I the Lord, which sanctify you, am holy.\r\n\r\n9 And the daughter of any priest, if she profane herself by playing the whore, she profaneth her father: she shall be burnt with fire.\r\n\r\n10 And he that is the high priest among his brethren, upon whose head the anointing oil was poured, and that is consecrated to put on the garments, shall not uncover his head, nor rend his clothes;11 Neither shall he go in to any dead body, nor defile himself for his father, or for his mother;12 Neither shall he go out of the sanctuary, nor profane the sanctuary of his God; for the crown of the anointing oil of his God is upon him: I am the Lord.13 And he shall take a wife in her virginity.14 A widow, or a divorced woman, or profane, or an harlot, these shall he not take: but he shall take a virgin of his own people to wife.15 Neither shall he profane his seed among his people: for I the Lord do sanctify him.\r\n\r\n16 And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,17 Speak unto Aaron, saying, Whosoever he be of thy seed in their generations that hath any blemish, let him not approach to offer the bread of his God.18 For whatsoever man he be that hath a blemish, he shall not approach: a blind man, or a lame, or he that hath a flat nose, or any thing superfluous,19 Or a man that is brokenfooted, or brokenhanded,20 Or crookbackt, or a dwarf, or that hath a blemish in his eye, or be scurvy, or scabbed, or hath his stones broken;21 No man that hath a blemish of the seed of Aaron the priest shall come nigh to offer the offerings of the Lord made by fire: he hath a blemish; he shall not come nigh to offer the bread of his God.22 He shall eat the bread of his God, both of the most holy, and of the holy.23 Only he shall not go in unto the vail, nor come nigh unto the altar, because he hath a blemish; that he profane not my sanctuaries: for I the Lord do sanctify them.24 And Moses told it unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all the children of Israel.221 And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,2 Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, that they separate themselves from the holy things of the children of Israel, and that they profane not my holy name in those things which they hallow unto me: I am the Lord.3 Say unto them, Whosoever he be of all your seed among your generations, that goeth unto the holy things, which the children of Israel hallow unto the Lord, having his uncleanness upon him, that soul shall be cut off from my presence: I am the Lord.4 What man soever of the seed of Aaron is a leper, or hath a running issue; he shall not eat of the holy things, until he be clean. And whoso toucheth any thing that is unclean by the dead, or a man whose seed goeth from him;5 Or whosoever toucheth any creeping thing, whereby he may be made unclean, or a man of whom he may take uncleanness, whatsoever uncleanness he hath;6 The soul which hath touched any such shall be unclean until even, and shall not eat of the holy things, unless he wash his flesh with water.7 And when the sun is down, he shall be clean, and shall afterward eat of the holy things; because it is his food.8 That which dieth of itself, or is torn with beasts, he shall not eat to defile himself therewith: I am the Lord.9 They shall therefore keep mine ordinance, lest they bear sin for it, and die therefore, if they profane it: I the Lord do sanctify them.\r\n\r\n10 There shall no stranger eat of the holy thing: a sojourner of the priest, or an hired servant, shall not eat of the holy thing.11 But if the priest buy any soul with his money, he shall eat of it, and he that is born in his house: they shall eat of his meat.12 If the priest's daughter also be married unto a stranger, she may not eat of an offering of the holy things.13 But if the priest's daughter be a widow, or divorced, and have no child, and is returned unto her father's house, as in her youth, she shall eat of her father's meat: but there shall no stranger eat thereof.\r\n\r\n14 And if a man eat of the holy thing unwittingly, then he shall put the fifth part thereof unto it, and shall give it unto the priest with the holy thing.15 And they shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel, which they offer unto the Lord;16 Or suffer them to bear the iniquity of trespass, when they eat their holy things: for I the Lord do sanctify them.\r\n\r\n17 And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,18 Speak unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all the children of Israel, and say unto them, Whatsoever he be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers in Israel, that will offer his oblation for all his vows, and for all his freewill offerings, which they will offer unto the Lord for a burnt offering;19 Ye shall offer at your own will a male without blemish, of the beeves, of the sheep, or of the goats.20 But whatsoever hath a blemish, that shall ye not offer: for it shall not be acceptable for you.21 And whosoever offereth a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the Lord to accomplish his vow, or a freewill offering in beeves or sheep, it shall be perfect to be accepted; there shall be no blemish therein.22 Blind, or broken, or maimed, or having a wen, or scurvy, or scabbed, ye shall not offer these unto the Lord, nor make an offering by fire of them upon the altar unto the Lord.23 Either a bullock or a lamb that hath any thing superfluous or lacking in his parts, that mayest thou offer for a freewill offering; but for a vow it shall not be accepted.24 Ye shall not offer unto the Lord that which is bruised, or crushed, or broken, or cut; neither shall ye make any offering thereof in your land.25 Neither from a stranger's hand shall ye offer the bread of your God of any of these; because their corruption is in them, and blemishes be in them: they shall not be accepted for you.\r\n\r\n26 And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,27 When a bullock, or a sheep, or a goat, is brought forth, then it shall be seven days under the dam; and from the eighth day and thenceforth it shall be accepted for an offering made by fire unto the Lord.28 And whether it be cow or ewe, ye shall not kill it and her young both in one day.29 And when ye will offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving unto the Lord, offer it at your own will.30 On the same day it shall be eaten up; ye shall leave none of it until the morrow: I am the Lord.31 Therefore shall ye keep my commandments, and do them: I am the Lord.32 Neither shall ye profane my holy name; but I will be hallowed among the children of Israel: I am the Lord which hallow you,33 That brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am the Lord.231 And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,2 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, Concerning the feasts of the Lord, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, even these are my feasts.3 Six days shall work be done: but the seventh day is the sabbath of rest, an holy convocation; ye shall do no work therein: it is the sabbath of the Lord in all your dwellings.\r\n\r\n4 These are the feasts of the Lord, even holy convocations, which ye shall proclaim in their seasons.5 In the fourteenth day of the first month at even is the Lord's passover.6 And on the fifteenth day of the same month is the feast of unleavened bread unto the Lord: seven days ye must eat unleavened bread.7 In the first day ye shall have an holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work therein.8 But ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord seven days: in the seventh day is an holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work therein.\r\n\r\n9 And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,10 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be come into the land which I give unto you, and shall reap the harvest thereof, then ye shall bring a sheaf of the firstfruits of your harvest unto the priest:11 And he shall wave the sheaf before the Lord, to be accepted for you: on the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall wave it.12 And ye shall offer that day when ye wave the sheaf an he lamb without blemish of the first year for a burnt offering unto the Lord.13 And the meat offering thereof shall be two tenth deals of fine flour mingled with oil, an offering made by fire unto the Lord for a sweet savour: and the drink offering thereof shall be of wine, the fourth part of an hin.14 And ye shall eat neither bread, nor parched corn, nor green ears, until the selfsame day that ye have brought an offering unto your God: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.\r\n\r\n15 And ye shall count unto you from the morrow after the sabbath, from the day that ye brought the sheaf of the wave offering; seven sabbaths shall be complete:16 Even unto the morrow after the seventh sabbath shall ye number fifty days; and ye shall offer a new meat offering unto the Lord.17 Ye shall bring out of your habitations two wave loaves of two tenth deals: they shall be of fine flour; they shall be baken with leaven; they are the firstfruits unto the Lord.18 And ye shall offer with the bread seven lambs without blemish of the first year, and one young bullock, and two rams: they shall be for a burnt offering unto the Lord, with their meat offering, and their drink offerings, even an offering made by fire, of sweet savour unto the Lord.19 Then ye shall sacrifice one kid of the goats for a sin offering, and two lambs of the first year for a sacrifice of peace offerings.20 And the priest shall wave them with the bread of the firstfruits for a wave offering before the Lord, with the two lambs: they shall be holy to the Lord for the priest.21 And ye shall proclaim on the selfsame day, that it may be an holy convocation unto you: ye shall do no servile work therein: it shall be a statute for ever in all your dwellings throughout your generations.\r\n\r\n22 And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not make clean riddance of the corners of thy field when thou reapest, neither shalt thou gather any gleaning of thy harvest: thou shalt leave them unto the poor, and to the stranger: I am the Lord your God.\r\n\r\n23 And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,24 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, In the seventh month, in the first day of the month, shall ye have a sabbath, a memorial of blowing of trumpets, an holy convocation.25 Ye shall do no servile work therein: but ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord.\r\n\r\n26 And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,27 Also on the tenth day of this seventh month there shall be a day of atonement: it shall be an holy convocation unto you; and ye shall afflict your souls, and offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord.28 And ye shall do no work in that same day: for it is a day of atonement, to make an atonement for you before the Lord your God.29 For whatsoever soul it be that shall not be afflicted in that same day, he shall be cut off from among his people.30 And whatsoever soul it be that doeth any work in that same day, the same soul will I destroy from among his people.31 Ye shall do no manner of work: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.32 It shall be unto you a sabbath of rest, and ye shall afflict your souls: in the ninth day of the month at even, from even unto even, shall ye celebrate your sabbath.\r\n\r\n33 And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,34 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, The fifteenth day of this seventh month shall be the feast of tabernacles for seven days unto the Lord.35 On the first day shall be an holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work therein.36 Seven days ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord: on the eighth day shall be an holy convocation unto you; and ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord: it is a solemn assembly; and ye shall do no servile work therein.37 These are the feasts of the Lord, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, to offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord, a burnt offering, and a meat offering, a sacrifice, and drink offerings, every thing upon his day:38 Beside the sabbaths of the Lord, and beside your gifts, and beside all your vows, and beside all your freewill offerings, which ye give unto the Lord.39 Also in the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when ye have gathered in the fruit of the land, ye shall keep a feast unto the Lord seven days: on the first day shall be a sabbath, and on the eighth day shall be a sabbath.40 And ye shall take you on the first day the boughs of goodly trees, branches of palm trees, and the boughs of thick trees, and willows of the brook; and ye shall rejoice before the Lord your God seven days.41 And ye shall keep it a feast unto the Lord seven days in the year. It shall be a statute for ever in your generations: ye shall celebrate it in the seventh month.42 Ye shall dwell in booths seven days; all that are Israelites born shall dwell in booths:43 That your generations may know that I made the children of Israel to dwell in booths, when I brought them out of the land of Egypt: I am the Lord your God.44 And Moses declared unto the children of Israel the feasts of the Lord.241 And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,2 Command the children of Israel, that they bring unto thee pure oil olive beaten for the light, to cause the lamps to burn continually.3 Without the vail of the testimony, in the tabernacle of the congregation, shall Aaron order it from the evening unto the morning before the Lord continually: it shall be a statute for ever in your generations.4 He shall order the lamps upon the pure candlestick before the Lord continually.\r\n\r\n5 And thou shalt take fine flour, and bake twelve cakes thereof: two tenth deals shall be in one cake.6 And thou shalt set them in two rows, six on a row, upon the pure table before the Lord.7 And thou shalt put pure frankincense upon each row, that it may be on the bread for a memorial, even an offering made by fire unto the Lord.8 Every sabbath he shall set it in order before the Lord continually, being taken from the children of Israel by an everlasting covenant.9 And it shall be Aaron's and his sons'; and they shall eat it in the holy place: for it is most holy unto him of the offerings of the Lord made by fire by a perpetual statute.\r\n\r\n10 And the son of an Israelitish woman, whose father was an Egyptian, went out among the children of Israel: and this son of the Israelitish woman and a man of Israel strove together in the camp;11 And the Israelitish woman's son blasphemed the name of the Lord, and cursed. And they brought him unto Moses: (and his mother's name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan:)12 And they put him in ward, that the mind of the Lord might be shewed them.13 And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,14 Bring forth him that hath cursed without the camp; and let all that heard him lay their hands upon his head, and let all the congregation stone him.15 And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, Whosoever curseth his God shall bear his sin.16 And he that blasphemeth the name of the Lord, he shall surely be put to death, and all the congregation shall certainly stone him: as well the stranger, as he that is born in the land, when he blasphemeth the name of the Lord, shall be put to death.\r\n\r\n17 And he that killeth any man shall surely be put to death.18 And he that killeth a beast shall make it good; beast for beast.19 And if a man cause a blemish in his neighbour; as he hath done, so shall it be done to him;20 Breach for breach, eye for eye, tooth for tooth: as he hath caused a blemish in a man, so shall it be done to him again.21 And he that killeth a beast, he shall restore it: and he that killeth a man, he shall be put to death.22 Ye shall have one manner of law, as well for the stranger, as for one of your own country: for I am the Lord your God.\r\n\r\n23 And Moses spake to the children of Israel, that they should bring forth him that had cursed out of the camp, and stone him with stones. And the children of Israel did as the Lord commanded Moses.251 And the Lord spake unto Moses in mount Sinai, saying,2 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land which I give you, then shall the land keep a sabbath unto the Lord.3 Six years thou shalt sow thy field, and six years thou shalt prune thy vineyard, and gather in the fruit thereof;4 But in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of rest unto the land, a sabbath for the Lord: thou shalt neither sow thy field, nor prune thy vineyard.5 That which groweth of its own accord of thy harvest thou shalt not reap, neither gather the grapes of thy vine undressed: for it is a year of rest unto the land.6 And the sabbath of the land shall be meat for you; for thee, and for thy servant, and for thy maid, and for thy hired servant, and for thy stranger that sojourneth with thee,7 And for thy cattle, and for the beast that are in thy land, shall all the increase thereof be meat.\r\n\r\n8 And thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee, seven times seven years; and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be unto thee forty and nine years.9 Then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubile to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month, in the day of atonement shall ye make the trumpet sound throughout all your land.10 And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof: it shall be a jubile unto you; and ye shall return every man unto his possession, and ye shall return every man unto his family.11 A jubile shall that fiftieth year be unto you: ye shall not sow, neither reap that which groweth of itself in it, nor gather the grapes in it of thy vine undressed.12 For it is the jubile; it shall be holy unto you: ye shall eat the increase thereof out of the field.13 In the year of this jubile ye shall return every man unto his possession.14 And if thou sell ought unto thy neighbour, or buyest ought of thy neighbour's hand, ye shall not oppress one another:15 According to the number of years after the jubile thou shalt buy of thy neighbour, and according unto the number of years of the fruits he shall sell unto thee:16 According to the multitude of years thou shalt increase the price thereof, and according to the fewness of years thou shalt diminish the price of it: for according to the number of the years of the fruits doth he sell unto thee.17 Ye shall not therefore oppress one another; but thou shalt fear thy God: for I am the Lord your God.\r\n\r\n18 Wherefore ye shall do my statutes, and keep my judgments, and do them; and ye shall dwell in the land in safety.19 And the land shall yield her fruit, and ye shall eat your fill, and dwell therein in safety.20 And if ye shall say, What shall we eat the seventh year? behold, we shall not sow, nor gather in our increase:21 Then I will command my blessing upon you in the sixth year, and it shall bring forth fruit for three years.22 And ye shall sow the eighth year, and eat yet of old fruit until the ninth year; until her fruits come in ye shall eat of the old store.\r\n\r\n23 The land shall not be sold for ever: for the land is mine; for ye are strangers and sojourners with me.24 And in all the land of your possession ye shall grant a redemption for the land.\r\n\r\n25 If thy brother be waxen poor, and hath sold away some of his possession, and if any of his kin come to redeem it, then shall he redeem that which his brother sold.26 And if the man have none to redeem it, and himself be able to redeem it;27 Then let him count the years of the sale thereof, and restore the overplus unto the man to whom he sold it; that he may return unto his possession.28 But if he be not able to restore it to him, then that which is sold shall remain in the hand of him that hath bought it until the year of jubile: and in the jubile it shall go out, and he shall return unto his possession.29 And if a man sell a dwelling house in a walled city, then he may redeem it within a whole year after it is sold; within a full year may he redeem it.30 And if it be not redeemed within the space of a full year, then the house that is in the walled city shall be established for ever to him that bought it throughout his generations: it shall not go out in the jubile.31 But the houses of the villages which have no wall round about them shall be counted as the fields of the country: they may be redeemed, and they shall go out in the jubile.32 Notwithstanding the cities of the Levites, and the houses of the cities of their possession, may the Levites redeem at any time.33 And if a man purchase of the Levites, then the house that was sold, and the city of his possession, shall go out in the year of jubile: for the houses of the cities of the Levites are their possession among the children of Israel.34 But the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold; for it is their perpetual possession.\r\n\r\n35 And if thy brother be waxen poor, and fallen in decay with thee; then thou shalt relieve him: yea, though he be a stranger, or a sojourner; that he may live with thee.36 Take thou no usury of him, or increase: but fear thy God; that thy brother may live with thee.37 Thou shalt not give him thy money upon usury, nor lend him thy victuals for increase.38 I am the Lord your God, which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, to give you the land of Canaan, and to be your God.\r\n\r\n39 And if thy brother that dwelleth by thee be waxen poor, and be sold unto thee; thou shalt not compel him to serve as a bondservant:40 But as an hired servant, and as a sojourner, he shall be with thee, and shall serve thee unto the year of jubile:41 And then shall he depart from thee, both he and his children with him, and shall return unto his own family, and unto the possession of his fathers shall he return.42 For they are my servants, which I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: they shall not be sold as bondmen.43 Thou shalt not rule over him with rigour; but shalt fear thy God.44 Both thy bondmen, and thy bondmaids, which thou shalt have, shall be of the heathen that are round about you; of them shall ye buy bondmen and bondmaids.45 Moreover of the children of the strangers that do sojourn among you, of them shall ye buy, and of their families that are with you, which they begat in your land: and they shall be your possession.46 And ye shall take them as an inheritance for your children after you, to inherit them for a possession; they shall be your bondmen for ever: but over your brethren the children of Israel, ye shall not rule one over another with rigour.\r\n\r\n47 And if a sojourner or stranger wax rich by thee, and thy brother that dwelleth by him wax poor, and sell himself unto the stranger or sojourner by thee, or to the stock of the stranger's family:48 After that he is sold he may be redeemed again; one of his brethren may redeem him:49 Either his uncle, or his uncle's son, may redeem him, or any that is nigh of kin unto him of his family may redeem him; or if he be able, he may redeem himself.50 And he shall reckon with him that bought him from the year that he was sold to him unto the year of jubile: and the price of his sale shall be according unto the number of years, according to the time of an hired servant shall it be with him.51 If there be yet many years behind, according unto them he shall give again the price of his redemption out of the money that he was bought for.52 And if there remain but few years unto the year of jubile, then he shall count with him, and according unto his years shall he give him again the price of his redemption.53 And as a yearly hired servant shall he be with him: and the other shall not rule with rigour over him in thy sight.54 And if he be not redeemed in these years, then he shall go out in the year of jubile, both he, and his children with him.55 For unto me the children of Israel are servants; they are my servants whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: I am the Lord your God.261 Ye shall make you no idols nor graven image, neither rear you up a standing image, neither shall ye set up any image of stone in your land, to bow down unto it: for I am the Lord your God.\r\n\r\n2 Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I am the Lord.\r\n\r\n3 If ye walk in my statutes, and keep my commandments, and do them;4 Then I will give you rain in due season, and the land shall yield her increase, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit.5 And your threshing shall reach unto the vintage, and the vintage shall reach unto the sowing time: and ye shall eat your bread to the full, and dwell in your land safely.6 And I will give peace in the land, and ye shall lie down, and none shall make you afraid: and I will rid evil beasts out of the land, neither shall the sword go through your land.7 And ye shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you by the sword.8 And five of you shall chase an hundred, and an hundred of you shall put ten thousand to flight: and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword.9 For I will have respect unto you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you, and establish my covenant with you.10 And ye shall eat old store, and bring forth the old because of the new.11 And I will set my tabernacle among you: and my soul shall not abhor you.12 And I will walk among you, and will be your God, and ye shall be my people.13 I am the Lord your God, which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, that ye should not be their bondmen; and I have broken the bands of your yoke, and made you go upright.\r\n\r\n14 But if ye will not hearken unto me, and will not do all these commandments;15 And if ye shall despise my statutes, or if your soul abhor my judgments, so that ye will not do all my commandments, but that ye break my covenant:16 I also will do this unto you; I will even appoint over you terror, consumption, and the burning ague, that shall consume the eyes, and cause sorrow of heart: and ye shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it.17 And I will set my face against you, and ye shall be slain before your enemies: they that hate you shall reign over you; and ye shall flee when none pursueth you.18 And if ye will not yet for all this hearken unto me, then I will punish you seven times more for your sins.19 And I will break the pride of your power; and I will make your heaven as iron, and your earth as brass:20 And your strength shall be spent in vain: for your land shall not yield her increase, neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruits.\r\n\r\n21 And if ye walk contrary unto me, and will not hearken unto me; I will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to your sins.22 I will also send wild beasts among you, which shall rob you of your children, and destroy your cattle, and make you few in number; and your high ways shall be desolate.23 And if ye will not be reformed by me by these things, but will walk contrary unto me;24 Then will I also walk contrary unto you, and will punish you yet seven times for your sins.25 And I will bring a sword upon you, that shall avenge the quarrel of my covenant: and when ye are gathered together within your cities, I will send the pestilence among you; and ye shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy.26 And when I have broken the staff of your bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver you your bread again by weight: and ye shall eat, and not be satisfied.27 And if ye will not for all this hearken unto me, but walk contrary unto me;28 Then I will walk contrary unto you also in fury; and I, even I, will chastise you seven times for your sins.29 And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat.30 And I will destroy your high places, and cut down your images, and cast your carcases upon the carcases of your idols, and my soul shall abhor you.31 And I will make your cities waste, and bring your sanctuaries unto desolation, and I will not smell the savour of your sweet odours.32 And I will bring the land into desolation: and your enemies which dwell therein shall be astonished at it.33 And I will scatter you among the heathen, and will draw out a sword after you: and your land shall be desolate, and your cities waste.34 Then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths, as long as it lieth desolate, and ye be in your enemies' land; even then shall the land rest, and enjoy her sabbaths.35 As long as it lieth desolate it shall rest; because it did not rest in your sabbaths, when ye dwelt upon it.36 And upon them that are left alive of you I will send a faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies; and the sound of a shaken leaf shall chase them; and they shall flee, as fleeing from a sword; and they shall fall when none pursueth.37 And they shall fall one upon another, as it were before a sword, when none pursueth: and ye shall have no power to stand before your enemies.38 And ye shall perish among the heathen, and the land of your enemies shall eat you up.39 And they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in your enemies' lands; and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them.\r\n\r\n40 If they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, with their trespass which they trespassed against me, and that also they have walked contrary unto me;41 And that I also have walked contrary unto them, and have brought them into the land of their enemies; if then their uncircumcised hearts be humbled, and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity:42 Then will I remember my covenant with Jacob, and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember; and I will remember the land.43 The land also shall be left of them, and shall enjoy her sabbaths, while she lieth desolate without them: and they shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity: because, even because they despised my judgments, and because their soul abhorred my statutes.44 And yet for all that, when they be in the land of their enemies, I will not cast them away, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly, and to break my covenant with them: for I am the Lord their God.45 But I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the heathen, that I might be their God: I am the Lord.46 These are the statutes and judgments and laws, which the Lord made between him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai by the hand of Moses.271 And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,2 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When a man shall make a singular vow, the persons shall be for the Lord by thy estimation.3 And thy estimation shall be of the male from twenty years old even unto sixty years old, even thy estimation shall be fifty shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary.4 And if it be a female, then thy estimation shall be thirty shekels.5 And if it be from five years old even unto twenty years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male twenty shekels, and for the female ten shekels.6 And if it be from a month old even unto five years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male five shekels of silver, and for the female thy estimation shall be three shekels of silver.7 And if it be from sixty years old and above; if it be a male, then thy estimation shall be fifteen shekels, and for the female ten shekels.8 But if he be poorer than thy estimation, then he shall present himself before the priest, and the priest shall value him; according to his ability that vowed shall the priest value him.9 And if it be a beast, whereof men bring an offering unto the Lord, all that any man giveth of such unto the Lord shall be holy.10 He shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good: and if he shall at all change beast for beast, then it and the exchange thereof shall be holy.11 And if it be any unclean beast, of which they do not offer a sacrifice unto the Lord, then he shall present the beast before the priest:12 And the priest shall value it, whether it be good or bad: as thou valuest it, who art the priest, so shall it be.13 But if he will at all redeem it, then he shall add a fifth part thereof unto thy estimation.\r\n\r\n14 And when a man shall sanctify his house to be holy unto the Lord, then the priest shall estimate it, whether it be good or bad: as the priest shall estimate it, so shall it stand.15 And if he that sanctified it will redeem his house, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto it, and it shall be his.16 And if a man shall sanctify unto the Lord some part of a field of his possession, then thy estimation shall be according to the seed thereof: an homer of barley seed shall be valued at fifty shekels of silver.17 If he sanctify his field from the year of jubile, according to thy estimation it shall stand.18 But if he sanctify his field after the jubile, then the priest shall reckon unto him the money according to the years that remain, even unto the year of the jubile, and it shall be abated from thy estimation.19 And if he that sanctified the field will in any wise redeem it, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto it, and it shall be assured to him.20 And if he will not redeem the field, or if he have sold the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed any more.21 But the field, when it goeth out in the jubile, shall be holy unto the Lord, as a field devoted; the possession thereof shall be the priest's.22 And if a man sanctify unto the Lord a field which he hath bought, which is not of the fields of his possession;23 Then the priest shall reckon unto him the worth of thy estimation, even unto the year of the jubile: and he shall give thine estimation in that day, as a holy thing unto the Lord.24 In the year of the jubile the field shall return unto him of whom it was bought, even to him to whom the possession of the land did belong.25 And all thy estimations shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary: twenty gerahs shall be the shekel.\r\n\r\n26 Only the firstling of the beasts, which should be the Lord's firstling, no man shall sanctify it; whether it be ox, or sheep: it is the Lord's.27 And if it be of an unclean beast, then he shall redeem it according to thine estimation, and shall add a fifth part of it thereto: or if it be not redeemed, then it shall be sold according to thy estimation.28 Notwithstanding no devoted thing, that a man shall devote unto the Lord of all that he hath, both of man and beast, and of the field of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed: every devoted thing is most holy unto the Lord.29 None devoted, which shall be devoted of men, shall be redeemed; but shall surely be put to death.30 And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land, or of the fruit of the tree, is the Lord's: it is holy unto the Lord.31 And if a man will at all redeem ought of his tithes, he shall add thereto the fifth part thereof.32 And concerning the tithe of the herd, or of the flock, even of whatsoever passeth under the rod, the tenth shall be

saying: Alleluia. Salvation, and glory, and power is to our God.\r\n2 For true and just are his judgments, who\r\nhath judged the great harlot which corrupted the\r\nearth with her fornication, and hath revenged\r\nthe blood of his servants, at her hands.\r\n3 And again they said: Alleluia. And her\r\nsmoke ascendeth for ever and ever.\r\n4 And the four and twenty ancients, and the\r\nfour living creatures fell down and adored God\r\nthat sitteth upon the throne, saying: Amen; Alleluia.\r\n5 And a voice came out from the throne, saying: Give praise to our God, all ye his servants;\r\nand you that fear him, little and great.\r\n6 And I heard as it were the voice of a great\r\nmultitude, and as the voice of many waters, and\r\nas the voice of great thunders, saying, Alleluia:\r\nfor the Lord our God the Almighty hath reigned.\r\n7 Let us be glad and rejoice, and give glory to\r\nhim; for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and\r\nhis wife hath prepared herself.\r\n8 And it is granted to her that she should\r\nclothe herself with fine linen, glittering and\r\nwhite. For the fine linen are the justifications\r\nof saints.\r\n9 And he said to me: Write: Blessed are they\r\nthat are called to the marriage supper of the\r\nLamb. And he saith to me: These words of God\r\nare true.\r\n10 And I fell down before his feet, to adore\r\nhim. And he saith to me: See thou do it not: I\r\nam thy fellow servant, and of thy brethren, who\r\nhave the testimony of Jesus. Adore God. For\r\nthe testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.\r\n11 And I saw heaven opened, and behold a\r\nwhite horse; and he that sat upon him was called\r\nfaithful and true, and with justice doth he judge\r\nand fight.\r\n12 And his eyes were as a flame of fire, and on\r\nhis head were many diadems, and he had a name\r\nThe Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle 1593\r\nwritten, which no man knoweth but himself.\r\n13 And he was clothed with a garment sprinkled with blood; and his name is called, THE\r\nWORD OF GOD.\r\n14 And the armies that are in heaven followed\r\nhim on white horses, clothed in fine linen, white\r\nand clean.\r\n15 And out of his mouth proceedeth a sharp\r\ntwo edged sword; that with it he may strike the\r\nnations. And he shall rule them with a rod of\r\niron; and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness of the wrath of God the Almighty.\r\n16 And he hath on his garment, and on his\r\nthigh written: KING OF KINGS, AND LORD\r\nOF LORDS.\r\n17 And I saw an angel standing in the sun,\r\nand he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the\r\nbirds that did fly through the midst of heaven:\r\nCome, gather yourselves together to the great\r\nsupper of God:\r\n18 That you may eat the flesh of kings, and\r\nthe flesh of tribunes, and the flesh of mighty men,\r\nand the flesh of horses, and of them that sit on\r\nthem, and the flesh of all freemen and bondmen,\r\nand of little and of great.\r\n19 And I saw the beast, and the kings of\r\nthe earth, and their armies gathered together to\r\nmake war with him that sat upon the horse, and\r\nwith his army.\r\n20 And the beast was taken, and with him\r\nthe false prophet, who wrought signs before him,\r\nwherewith he seduced them who received the\r\ncharacter of the beast, and who adored his image. These two were cast alive into the pool of\r\nfire, burning with brimstone.\r\n21 And the rest were slain by the sword of him\r\nthat sitteth upon the horse, which proceedeth\r\nout of his mouth; and all the birds were filled\r\nwith their flesh.\r\nChapter 20\r\nAnd I saw an angel coming down from heaven,\r\nhaving the key of the bottomless pit, and a great\r\nchain in his hand.\r\n2 And he laid hold on the dragon the old serpent, which is the devil and Satan, and bound\r\nhim for a thousand years.\r\n3 And he cast him into the bottomless pit,\r\nand shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that\r\nhe should no more seduce the nations, till the\r\nthousand years be finished. And after that, he\r\nmust be loosed a little time.\r\n4 And I saw seats; and they sat upon them;\r\nand judgment was given unto them; and the\r\nsouls of them that were beheaded for the testimony of Jesus, and for the word of God, and\r\nwho had not adored the beast nor his image,\r\nnor received his character on their foreheads, or\r\nin their hands; and they lived and reigned with\r\nChrist a thousand years.\r\n5 The rest of the dead lived not, till the thousand years were finished. This is the first resurrection.\r\n6 Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the\r\nfirst resurrection. In these the second death hath\r\nno power; but they shall be priests of God and\r\nof Christ; and shall reign with him a thousand\r\nyears.\r\n7 And when the thousand years shall be finished, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison, and\r\nshall go forth, and seduce the nations, which are\r\nover the four quarters of the earth, Gog, and\r\nMagog, and shall gather them together to battle, the number of whom is as the sand of the\r\nsea.\r\n8 And they came upon the breadth of the\r\nearth, and encompassed the camp of the saints,\r\nand the beloved city.\r\n9 And there came down fire from God out of\r\n1594 The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle\r\nheaven, and devoured them; and the devil, who\r\nseduced them, was cast into the pool of fire and\r\nbrimstone, where both the beast\r\n10 And the false prophet shall be tormented\r\nday and night for ever and ever.\r\n11 And I saw a great white throne, and one\r\nsitting upon it, from whose face the earth and\r\nheaven fled away, and there was no place found\r\nfor them.\r\n12 And I saw the dead, great and small, standing in the presence of the throne, and the books\r\nwere opened; and another book was opened,\r\nwhich is the book of life; and the dead were\r\njudged by those things which were written in the\r\nbooks, according to their works.\r\n13 And the sea gave up the dead that were in\r\nit, and death and hell gave up their dead that\r\nwere in them; and they were judged every one\r\naccording to their works.\r\n14 And hell and death were cast into the pool\r\nof fire. This is the second death.\r\n15 And whosoever was not found written in\r\nthe book of life, was cast into the pool of fire.\r\nChapter 21\r\nAnd I saw a new heaven and a new earth. For\r\nthe first heaven and the first earth was gone, and\r\nthe sea is now no more.\r\n2 And I John saw the holy city, the new\r\nJerusalem, coming down out of heaven from\r\nGod, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.\r\n3 And I heard a great voice from the throne,\r\nsaying: Behold the tabernacle of God with men,\r\nand he will dwell with them. And they shall be\r\nhis people; and God himself with them shall be\r\ntheir God.\r\n4 And God shall wipe away all tears from their\r\neyes: and death shall be no more, nor mourning,\r\nnor crying, nor sorrow shall be any more, for the\r\nformer things are passed away.\r\n5 And he that sat on the throne, said: Behold,\r\nI make all things new. And he said to me: Write,\r\nfor these words are most faithful and true.\r\n6 And he said to me: It is done. I am Alpha\r\nand Omega; the beginning and the end. To him\r\nthat thirsteth, I will give of the fountain of the\r\nwater of life, freely.\r\n7 He that shall overcome shall possess these\r\nthings, and I will be his God; and he shall be my\r\nson.\r\n8 But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the\r\nabominable, and murderers, and whoremongers,\r\nand sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, they\r\nshall have their portion in the pool burning with\r\nfire and brimstone, which is the second death.\r\n9 And there came one of the seven angels, who\r\nhad the vials full of the seven last plagues, and\r\nspoke with me, saying: Come, and I will shew\r\nthee the bride, the wife of the Lamb.\r\n10 And he took me up in spirit to a great and\r\nhigh mountain: and he shewed me the holy city\r\nJerusalem coming down out of heaven from God,\r\n11 Having the glory of God, and the light\r\nthereof was like to a precious stone, as to the\r\njasper stone, even as crystal.\r\n12 And it had a wall great and high, having\r\ntwelve gates, and in the gates twelve angels, and\r\nnames written thereon, which are the names of\r\nthe twelve tribes of the children of Israel.\r\n13 On the east, three gates: and on the north,\r\nthree gates: and on the south, three gates: and\r\non the west, three gates.\r\n14 And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in them, the twelve names of the\r\ntwelve apostles of the Lamb.\r\n15 And he that spoke with me, had a measure\r\nof a reed of gold, to measure the city and the\r\nThe Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle 1595\r\ngates thereof, and the wall.\r\n16 And the city lieth in a foursquare, and the\r\nlength thereof is as great as the breadth: and he\r\nmeasured the city with the golden reed for twelve\r\nthousand furlongs, and the length and the height\r\nand the breadth thereof are equal.\r\n17 And he measured the wall thereof an hundred and forty-four cubits, the measure of a man,\r\nwhich is of an angel.\r\n18 And the building of the wall thereof was of\r\njasper stone: but the city itself pure gold, like to\r\nclear glass.\r\n19 And the foundations of the wall of the city\r\nwere adorned with all manner of precious stones.\r\nThe first foundation was jasper: the second, sapphire: the third, a chalcedony: the fourth, an\r\nemerald:\r\n20 The fifth, sardonyx: the sixth, sardius: the\r\nseventh, chrysolite: the eighth, beryl: the ninth,\r\na topaz: the tenth, a chrysoprasus: the eleventh,\r\na jacinth: the twelfth, an amethyst.\r\n21 And the twelve gates are twelve pearls, one\r\nto each: and every several gate was of one several\r\npearl. And the street of the city was pure gold,\r\nas it were transparent glass.\r\n22 And I saw no temple therein. For the Lord\r\nGod Almighty is the temple thereof, and the\r\nLamb.\r\n23 And the city hath no need of the sun, nor\r\nof the moon, to shine in it. For the glory of God\r\nhath enlightened it, and the Lamb is the lamp\r\nthereof.\r\n24 And the nations shall walk in the light of\r\nit: and the kings of the earth shall bring their\r\nglory and honour into it.\r\n25 And the gates thereof shall not be shut by\r\nday: for there shall be no night there.\r\n26 And they shall bring the glory and honour\r\nof the nations into it.\r\n27 There shall not enter into it any thing defiled, or that worketh abomination or maketh a\r\nlie, but they that are written in the book of life\r\nof the Lamb.\r\nChapter 22\r\nAnd he showed me a river of water of life, clear\r\nas crystal, proceeding from the throne of God\r\nand of the Lamb.\r\n2 In the midst of the street thereof, and on\r\nboth sides of the river, was the tree of life, bearing twelve fruits, yielding its fruits every month,\r\nand the leaves of the tree were for the healing of\r\nthe nations.\r\n3 And there shall be no curse any more; but\r\nthe throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in\r\nit, and his servants shall serve him.\r\n4 And they shall see his face: and his name\r\nshall be on their foreheads.\r\n5 And night shall be no more: and they shall\r\nnot need the light of the lamp, nor the light of\r\nthe sun, because the Lord God shall enlighten\r\nthem, and they shall reign for ever and ever.\r\n6 And he said to me: These words are most\r\nfaithful and true. And the Lord God of the spirits of the prophets sent his angel to shew his\r\nservants the things which must be done shortly.\r\n7 And, Behold I come quickly. Blessed is he\r\nthat keepeth the words of the prophecy of this\r\nbook.\r\n8 And I, John, who have heard and seen these\r\nthings. And after I had heard and seen, I fell\r\ndown to adore before the feet of the angel, who\r\nshewed me these things.\r\n9 And he said to me: See thou do it not: for\r\nI am thy fellow servant, and of thy brethren the\r\nprophets, and of them that keep the words of the\r\nprophecy of this book. Adore God.\r\n1596 The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle\r\n10 And he saith to me: Seal not the words\r\nof the prophecy of this book: for the time is at\r\nhand.\r\n11 He that hurteth, let him hurt still: and he\r\nthat is filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that\r\nis just, let him be justified still: and he that is\r\nholy, let him be sanctified still.\r\n12 Behold, I come quickly; and my reward is\r\nwith me, to render to every man according to his\r\nworks.\r\n13 I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the\r\nlast, the beginning and the end.\r\n14 Blessed are they that wash their robes in\r\nthe blood of the Lamb: that they may have a\r\nright to the tree of life, and may enter in by the\r\ngates into the city.\r\n15 Without are dogs, and sorcerers, and unchaste, and murderers, and servers of idols, and\r\nevery one that loveth and maketh a lie.\r\n16 I Jesus have sent my angel, to testify to\r\nyou these things in the churches. I am the root\r\nand stock of David, the bright and morning star.\r\n17 And the spirit and the bride say: Come.\r\nAnd he that heareth, let him say: Come. And\r\nhe that thirsteth, let him come: and he that will,\r\nlet him take the water of life, freely.\r\n18 For I testify to every one that heareth the\r\nwords of the prophecy of this book: If any man\r\nshall add to these things, God shall add unto\r\nhim the plagues written in this book.\r\n19 And if any man shall take away from the\r\nwords of the book of this prophecy, God shall\r\ntake away his part out of the book of life, and\r\nout of the holy city, and from these things that\r\nare written in this book.\r\n20 He that giveth testimony of these things,\r\nsaith, Surely I come quickly: Amen. Come, Lord\r\nJesus.\r\n21 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with\r\nyou all. Amen.\r\n*/\r\npragma solidity 0.8.20;\r\n\r\nabstract contract Context {\r\n    function _msgSender() internal view virtual returns (address) {\r\n        return msg.sender;\r\n
