     *  @dev Deliver an asset and deliver to the specified party
     *  When implementing this interface, please ensure you restrict access.
     *  If using LazyDeliver.sol, you can use authorizedDelivererRequired modifier to restrict access.
     *  Delivery can be for an existing asset or newly minted assets.
     *
     *  @param listingId      The listingId associated with this delivery.  Useful for permissioning.
     *  @param to             The address to deliver the asset to
     *  @param assetId        The assetId to deliver
     *  @param payableCount   The number of assets to deliver
     *  @param payableAmount  The amount seller will receive upon delivery of asset
     *  @param payableERC20   The erc20 token address of the amount (0x0 if ETH)
     *  @param index          (Optional): Index value for certain sales methods
     *
     *  Suggestion: If determining a refund amount based on total sales data, do not enable this function
     *              until the sales data is finalized and recorded in contract
     *
     *  Exploit Prevention for dynamic/random assignment
     *  1. Ensure attributes are not assigned until AFTER underlying mint if using _safeMint.
     *     This is to ensure a receiver cannot check attribute values on receive and revert transaction.
     *     However, even if this is the case, the recipient can wrap its mint in a contract that checks
     *     post mint completion and reverts if unsuccessful.
     *  2. Ensure that "to" is not a contract address. This prevents a contract from doing the lazy
     *     mint, which could exploit random assignment by reverting if they do not receive the desired
     *     item post mint.
