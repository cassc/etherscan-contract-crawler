 * @title  DirectLoanFixedOfferRedeploy
 * @author NFTfi
 * @notice Same as DirectLoanFixedOffer, we have to duplicate it because we have to re-deploy,
 * but we need the old and the new simultaneously in the coordinator
 *
 *
 * Main contract for NFTfi Direct Loans Fixed Type. This contract manages the ability to create NFT-backed
 * peer-to-peer loans of type Fixed (agreed to be a fixed-repayment loan) where the borrower pays the
 * maximumRepaymentAmount regardless of whether they repay early or not.
 *
 * There are two ways to commence an NFT-backed loan:
 *
 * a. The borrower accepts a lender's offer by calling `acceptOffer`.
 *   1. the borrower calls nftContract.approveAll(NFTfi), approving the NFTfi contract to move their NFT's on their
 * be1alf.
 *   2. the lender calls erc20Contract.approve(NFTfi), allowing NFTfi to move the lender's ERC20 tokens on their
 * behalf.
 *   3. the lender signs an off-chain message, proposing its offer terms.
 *   4. the borrower calls `acceptOffer` to accept these terms and enter into the loan. The NFT is stored in
 * the contract, the borrower receives the loan principal in the specified ERC20 currency, the lender receives an
 * NFTfi promissory note (in ERC721 form) that represents the rights to either the principal-plus-interest, or the
 * underlying NFT collateral if the borrower does not pay back in time, and the borrower receives obligation receipt
 * (in ERC721 form) that gives them the right to pay back the loan and get the collateral back.
 *
 * b. The lender accepts a borrowe's binding terms by calling `acceptListing`.
 *   1. the borrower calls nftContract.approveAll(NFTfi), approving the NFTfi contract to move their NFT's on their
 * be1alf.
 *   2. the lender calls erc20Contract.approve(NFTfi), allowing NFTfi to move the lender's ERC20 tokens on their
 * behalf.
 *   3. the borrower signs an off-chain message, proposing its binding terms.
 *   4. the lender calls `acceptListing` with an offer matching the binding terms and enter into the loan. The NFT is
 * stored in the contract, the borrower receives the loan principal in the specified ERC20 currency, the lender
 * receives an NFTfi promissory note (in ERC721 form) that represents the rights to either the principal-plus-interest,
 * or the underlying NFT collateral if the borrower does not pay back in time, and the borrower receives obligation
 * receipt (in ERC721 form) that gives them the right to pay back the loan and get the collateral back.
 *
 * The lender can freely transfer and trade this ERC721 promissory note as they wish, with the knowledge that
 * transferring the ERC721 promissory note tranfsers the rights to principal-plus-interest and/or collateral, and that
 * they will no longer have a claim on the loan. The ERC721 promissory note itself represents that claim.
 *
 * The borrower can freely transfer and trade this ERC721 obligaiton receipt as they wish, with the knowledge that
 * transferring the ERC721 obligaiton receipt tranfsers the rights right to pay back the loan and get the collateral
 * back.
 *
 *
 * A loan may end in one of two ways:
 * - First, a borrower may call NFTfi.payBackLoan() and pay back the loan plus interest at any time, in which case they
 * receive their NFT back in the same transaction.
 * - Second, if the loan's duration has passed and the loan has not been paid back yet, a lender can call
 * NFTfi.liquidateOverdueLoan(), in which case they receive the underlying NFT collateral and forfeit the rights to the
 * principal-plus-interest, which the borrower now keeps.
