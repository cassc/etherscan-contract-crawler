/**
 * @dev Implementation of the {IERC20} interface.
 *
 * This implementation is agnostic to the way tokens are created. This means
 * that a supply mechanism has to be added in a derived contract using {_mint}.
 * For a generic mechanism see {ERC20PresetMinterPauser}.
 *
 * TIP: For a detailed writeup see our guide
 * https://forum.zeppelin.solutions/t/how-to-implement-erc20-supply-mechanisms/226[How
 * to implement supply mechanisms].
 *
 * We have followed general OpenZeppelin guidelines: functions revert instead
 * of returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless conventional
 * and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20 applications.
 *
 * Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}.
 * This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just
 * by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit
 * these events, as it isn't required by the specification.
 *
 * Finally, the non-standard {decreaseAllowance} and {increaseAllowance}
 * functions have been added to mitigate the well-known issues around setting
 * allowances. See {IERC20-approve}.

/*
    Source: https://github.com/iearn-finance/yearn-protocol/blob/develop/contracts/vaults/yVault.sol
    
    Changelog:

    V1.1
    * Strategist no longer has special function calling permissions
    * Version function added to contract
    * All write functions, with the exception of transfer, are pausable
    * Keeper or governance can pause
    * Only governance can unpause

    V1.2
    * Transfer functions are now pausable along with all other non-permissioned write functions
    * All permissioned write functions, with the exception of pause() & unpause(), are pausable as well

    V1.3
    * Add guest list functionality
    * All deposits can be optionally gated by external guestList approval logic on set guestList contract

    V1.4
    * Add depositFor() to deposit on the half of other users. That user will then be blockLocked.

    V1.5
    * Removed Controller
        - Removed harvest from vault (only on strategy)
    * Params added to track autocompounded rewards (lifeTimeEarned, lastHarvestedAt, lastHarvestAmount, assetsAtLastHarvest)
      this would work in sync with autoCompoundRatio to help us track harvests better.
    * Fees
        - Strategy would report the autocompounded harvest amount to the vault
        - Calculation performanceFeeGovernance, performanceFeeStrategist, withdrawalFee, managementFee moved to the vault.
        - Vault mints shares for performanceFees and managementFee to the respective recipient (treasury, strategist)
        - withdrawal fees is transferred to the rewards address set
    * Permission:
        - Strategist can now set performance, withdrawal and management fees
        - Governance will determine maxPerformanceFee, maxWithdrawalFee, maxManagementFee that can be set to prevent rug of funds.
    * Strategy would take the actors from the vault it is connected to
    * All governance related fees goes to treasury
    
    V1.5.1
    * Added Events for `PerformanceFeeGovernance`, `PerformanceFeeStrategist` and `WithdrawalFee`
