     * - loanERC20Denomination: The address of the ERC20 contract of the currency being used as principal/interest
     * for this loan.
     * - minLoanPrincipalAmount: The minumum sum of money transferred from lender to borrower at the beginning of
     * the loan, measured in loanERC20Denomination's smallest units.
     * - maxLoanPrincipalAmount: The  sum of money transferred from lender to borrower at the beginning of
     * the loan, measured in loanERC20Denomination's smallest units.
     * - maximumRepaymentAmount: The maximum amount of money that the borrower would be required to retrieve their
     * collateral, measured in the smallest units of the ERC20 currency used for the loan. The borrower will always have
     * to pay this amount to retrieve their collateral, regardless of whether they repay early.
     * - nftCollateralContract: The address of the ERC721 contract of the NFT collateral.
     * - nftCollateralId: The ID within the NFTCollateralContract for the NFT being used as collateral for this
     * loan. The NFT is stored within this contract during the duration of the loan.
     * - revenueSharePartner: The address of the partner that will receive the revenue share.
     * - minLoanDuration: The minumum amount of time (measured in seconds) that can elapse before the lender can
     * liquidate the loan and seize the underlying collateral NFT.
     * - maxLoanDuration: The maximum amount of time (measured in seconds) that can elapse before the lender can
     * liquidate the loan and seize the underlying collateral NFT.
     * - maxInterestRateForDurationInBasisPoints: This is maximum the interest rate (measured in basis points, e.g.
     * hundreths of a percent) for the loan, that must be repaid pro-rata by the borrower at the conclusion of the loan
     * or risk seizure of their nft collateral. Note if the type of the loan is fixed then this value  is not used and
     * is irrelevant so it should be set to 0.
     * - referralFeeInBasisPoints: The percent (measured in basis points) of the loan principal amount that will be
     * taken as a fee to pay to the referrer, 0 if the lender is not paying referral fee.
     * @param _signature - The offer struct containing:
     * - signer: The address of the signer. The borrower for `acceptOffer` the lender for `acceptListing`.
     * - nonce: The nonce referred here is not the same as an Ethereum account's nonce.
     * We are referring instead to a nonce that is used by the lender or the borrower when they are first signing
     * off-chain NFTfi orders. These nonce can be any uint256 value that the user has not previously used to sign an
     * off-chain order. Each nonce can be used at most once per user within NFTfi, regardless of whether they are the
     * lender or the borrower in that situation. This serves two purposes:
     *   - First, it prevents replay attacks where an attacker would submit a user's off-chain order more than once.
     *   - Second, it allows a user to cancel an off-chain order by calling
     * NFTfi.cancelLoanCommitmentBeforeLoanHasBegun(), which marks the nonce as used and prevents any future loan from
     * using the user's off-chain order that contains that nonce.
     * - expiry: Date when the signature expires
     * - signature: The ECDSA signature of the borrower, obtained off-chain ahead of time, signing the following
     * combination of parameters:
     *   - listingTerms.loanERC20Denomination,

     * liquidate the loan and seize the underlying collateral NFT.
     * @param _newMaximumRepaymentAmount - The new maximum amount of money that the borrower would be required to
     * retrieve their collateral, measured in the smallest units of the ERC20 currency used for the loan. The
     * borrower will always have to pay this amount to retrieve their collateral, regardless of whether they repay
     * early.
     * @param _renegotiationFee Agreed upon fee in ether that borrower pays for the lender for the renegitiation
     * @param _signature - The signature structure containing:
     * - signer: The address of the signer. The borrower for `acceptOffer` the lender for `acceptListing`.
     * - nonce: The nonce referred here is not the same as an Ethereum account's nonce.
     * We are referring instead to a nonce that is used by the lender or the borrower when they are first signing
     * off-chain NFTfi orders. These nonce can be any uint256 value that the user has not previously used to sign an
     * off-chain order. Each nonce can be used at most once per user within NFTfi, regardless of whether they are the
     * lender or the borrower in that situation. This serves two purposes:
     * - First, it prevents replay attacks where an attacker would submit a user's off-chain order more than once.
     * - Second, it allows a user to cancel an off-chain order by calling NFTfi.cancelLoanCommitmentBeforeLoanHasBegun()
     * , which marks the nonce as used and prevents any future loan from using the user's off-chain order that contains
     * that nonce.
     * - expiry - The date when the renegotiation offer expires
     * - lenderSignature - The ECDSA signature of the lender, obtained off-chain ahead of time, signing the
     * following combination of parameters:
     * - _loanId
     * - _newLoanDuration
     * - _newMaximumRepaymentAmount
     * - _lender
     * - _lenderNonce
     * - _expiry
     * - address of this contract
     * - chainId
