/**
 * @title Recoverable
 * In case of tokens that represent real-world assets such as shares of a company, one needs a way
 * to handle lost private keys. With physical certificates, courts can declare share certificates as
 * invalid so the company can issue replacements. Here, we want a solution that does not depend on
 * third parties to resolve such cases. Instead, when someone has lost a private key, he can use the
 * declareLost function on the recovery hub to post a deposit and claim that the shares assigned to a
 * specific address are lost.
 * If an attacker trying to claim shares belonging to someone else, they risk losing the deposit
 * as it can be claimed at anytime by the rightful owner.
 * Furthermore, if "getClaimDeleter" is defined in the subclass, the returned address is allowed to
 * delete claims, returning the collateral. This can help to prevent obvious cases of abuse of the claim
 * function, e.g. cases of front-running.
 * Most functionality is implemented in a shared RecoveryHub.
