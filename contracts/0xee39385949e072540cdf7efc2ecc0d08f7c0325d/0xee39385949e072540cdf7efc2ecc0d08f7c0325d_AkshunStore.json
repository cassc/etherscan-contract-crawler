A nonce of a contract is only incremented when that contract creates another contract. There is no built-in method for a contract to access an account's nonce, including its own - hence, this contract uses its storage to keep track of the nonce for its senders, via this var. Note that via the frontend you can get those nonces via e.g. `web3.eth.getTransactionCount` funciton, but the nonce here is specifically for the TXs that were sent to this contract (by this contract's senders), so we need to use this one always for the senders, and can use the mentioned function call just for the contract's nonce, in our case.\\n    // NOTE: Since we use `uint24` type for the state vars which represent quantities per season (and its lower store nodes), e.g. the number of NFTs for the particular season (i.e. `Season.maxSupply` field; e.g. imagine 1 NFT per 2^24 = 16,8 million unique users for the particular season), we implicitly limit the size of the state vars, both dynamic arrays and mappings, which store user wallet and contract addresses doing state changing interactions with our contract (specifically, the ones successfully calling (i.e. without TX reverting) functions which update this state var), to `uint40` possible values altogether (i.e. across all seasons of all leagues and sports), and we don't limit the size to `uint32` possible values instead, because a user may use many wallets or contracts to interact with our contract, hence we add extra 8 bytes of possible values (i.e. 2^8 = 256 wallets and contracts per each NFT (ownable/transferable by the same user) from across all seasons' collections), which allows 2^40 / 2^24 = 256 * 256 = 65536 times more possible values.

Hence the limit shouldn't be reachable. Note, however, that we can optimize gas consumption when storing or loading statically-sized variables, because in state variables, structs and statically sized arrays (actually, this is true for all statically-sized variables, except for mappings and dynamically-sized arrays), e.g. `uint8` does cost less than a traditional `uint`, because of the tight variable packing feature (coding pattern; which is unfortunately, until the time of writing, not automatically achieved by the optimizer). Also be sure that in structs your uints are next to your other uints, and bytes next to bytes, etc., because this further increases the tightly packed features, because the order you declare your state vars can affect the overall number of storage slots your contract uses. If you declare 2 `uint128`'s and then a `uin256`, that will use 2 256-bit storage slots; 1 slot for the 2 `uint128`'s and 1 slot for the `uint256`. If you declare 1 `uint128`, then a `uint256`, then a `uint128`, your contract will use 3 storage slots, because it can't fit the middle `uint256` state variable into a storage slot with either of the `uint128`'s, so each variable will need to have its own storage slot. Note, by default, to put the dynamic types / (state) vars (i.e. `bytes`, dynamically-sized arrays and `mapping`s) at the end or the beginning, before other, statically-sized types / (state) vars; but this tactic might not always use less gas (if at all - not verified!) (if optimizer is enabled, it might use even more gas, but just for the initial deployment of contracts and libraries, of course). Note that the difference between the gas cost to deploy `unit8` and `uint256` is geeting smaller with newer versions of Solidity, e.g. in Solidity 0.8.10 the `unit8` is now only 100 gas more expensive than `uint256`, compared to the SOLC 0.4.18, where they cost 75414 and 73867 gas respectively, i.e. a difference of 1547 gas. Note also that using bigger types will make the signatures which use vars with such types significantly larger then they could have been, leading to tangible increase in the gas price of all the methods which deal with such signatures. See: https://fravoll.github.io/solidity-patterns/tight_variable_packing.html\\n        // NOTE: Related to the upper note, using smaller type values for storage hence makes sense, because writing to storage is expensive, and the compiler will pack multiple smaller arguments.

Nowdays it's common to use the \\\"Ethereum\\\" prefix even if the message is intended for other EVM networks such as Polygon.\\n    // NOTE: The specific specific byte `0x19` was standardized simply because an already existing implementation (in the Go Ethereum client software, i.e. Geth) was using it before the standard was finalized. And the last number (`32` in this case) is the byte length of the message (excluding the prefix) that is being signed.\\n    // NOTE: E.g. Geth client software prepends the string `\\\\x19Ethereum Signed Message:\\\\n32` to all data before signing it (https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JSON-RPC#eth_sign). If you want to verify such a signature from Solidity, you have to prepend the same string in Solidity before doing the `ecrecover`. The reason was that by allowing signing arbitrary data, a DApp can trick the user to sign a transaction masqueraded as some arbitrary application data. This prefix ensures that no matter what data a DApp sends to Geth, it cannot be abused as a transaction. To use this mechanism for signature verification in solidity, you'll need to have your contract also do this prefixing.\\n    function _getEthPrefixedHash(bytes32 _hash)\\n        private\\n        pure\\n        returns(bytes32)\\n    {\\n        return keccak256(abi.encodePacked(\\\"\\\\x19Ethereum Signed Message:\\\\n32\\\", _hash));\\n    }\\n\\n    function _splitSignature(bytes memory _signature)\\n        private\\n        pure\\n        returns(uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s)\\n    {\\n        // Validate input params.\\n\\n        if (_signature.length != 65) revert SignatureInvalid();\\n\\n        assembly {\\n            // First 32 bytes, after the length prefix.\\n            r := mload(add(_signature, 32))\\n            // Second 32 bytes.\\n            s := mload(add(_signature, 64))\\n            // Final byte (first byte of the next 32 bytes).\\n            v := byte(0, mload(add(_signature, 96)))\\n        }\\n\\n        return (v, r, s);\\n    }\\n\\n    function _recoverSigner(bytes32 _message, bytes memory _signature)\\n        private\\n        pure\\n        returns(address _signer)\\n    {\\n        (uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) = _splitSignature(_signature);\\n\\n        return ecrecover(_message, v, r, s);\\n    }\\n\\n    // =======================================================================\\n    // Validator functions.\\n    // =======================================================================\\n\\n    // Same as `verifyNonOwnerCallSignature` function, except that it's meant for the cases where the signer (e.g. operator) is also the sender, or the sender is controlled by or in the same trustworthy group as the signer (e.g. automator).

Unix time is traditionally stored in a 32-bit number. This will lead to the \\\"Year 2038\\\" problem, when 32-bit Unix timestamps will overflow, because it won't be able to store that high number.

Note the delta time shouldn't be too small in practice, since miners can vary or cheat the timestamp of the block by some tolerance. In practice, there has not been any notable timestamp skew ever. The block time itself is ~15 seconds, so as a rule of thumb it would be accurate to a minute. The only rule about timestamps is that the timestamp of a block must be greater than the previous block's timestamp; there is no other rule - old docs such as the white paper and wiki may mention 15 minutes (900 seconds), but these were corrected; the Yellow paper is the formal specification (see Block Header Validity (section 4.4.4, equation 48)). Small differences in time are tolerated by nodes, but as one node's time gets further away from the Coordinated UTC Time (per Network Time Protocol (NTP)), its number of peers will reduce and eventually it will have zero peers and be disconnected from the network.

Solidity solves this problem like Python in that it uses C3 Linearization to force a specific order in the directed acyclic graph (DAG) of base classes. This results in the desirable property of monotonicity but disallows some inheritance graphs, especially, the order in which the base classes are given in the `is` directive is important. You have to list the direct base contracts in the order from \\\"most base-like\\\" (i.e. classes on the top level of inheritance) to \\\"most derived\\\" (i.e. classes on lower levels). Note that this order is the reverse of the one used in Python. When a function is called that is defined multiple times in different contracts, the given bases are searched from right to left (left to right in Python) in a depth-first manner, stopping at the first match. If a base contract has already been searched, it is skipped. E.g. in `contract C is A, B {}`, `C` requests `B` to override `A` (by specifying `A, B` in this order), and then `C` overrides `B`. Note that this means the default preference is to specify the inherited interfaces and directly inherited/dependent (abstract) contracts at the beginning.
