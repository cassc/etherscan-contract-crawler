Signing only trusted and human-readable public schema data is a good practice. Additionally,\\r\\n * the Myso team recommends that the signer should use a purpose-bound address for signing to reduce the chance\\r\\n * for a compromised private key to result in loss of funds. The Myso team also recommends that even vaults owned\\r\\n * by an EOA should have multiple signers to reduce chance of forged quotes. In the event that a signer is compromised,\\r\\n * the vault owner should immediately remove the compromised signer and if possible, add a new signer.\\r\\n */\\r\\n\\r\\ncontract LenderVaultImpl
