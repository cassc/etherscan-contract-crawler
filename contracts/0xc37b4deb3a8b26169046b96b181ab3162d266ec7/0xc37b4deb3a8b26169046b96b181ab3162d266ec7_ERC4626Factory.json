The first is that a valid permit signature\\n * expresses an allowance, and it should not be assumed to convey additional meaning.

The second is that because permits have\\n * built-in replay protection and can be submitted by anyone, they can be frontrun. A protocol that uses permits should\\n * take this into consideration and allow a `permit` call to fail. Combining these two aspects, a pattern that may be\\n * generally recommended is:\\n *\\n * ```solidity\\n * function doThingWithPermit(..., uint256 value, uint256 deadline, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) public {\\n *     try token.permit(msg.sender, address(this), value, deadline, v, r, s) {} catch {}\\n *     doThing(..., value);\\n * }\\n *\\n * function doThing(..., uint256 value) public {\\n *     token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), value);\\n *     ...\\n * }\\n * ```\\n *\\n * Observe that: 1) `msg.sender` is used as the owner, leaving no ambiguity as to the signer intent, and 2) the use of\\n * `try/catch` allows the permit to fail and makes the code tolerant to frontrunning. (See also\\n * {SafeERC20-safeTransferFrom}).\\n *\\n * Additionally, note that smart contract wallets (such as Argent or Safe) are not able to produce permit signatures, so\\n * contracts should have entry points that don't rely on permit.\\n */\\ninterface IERC20Permit {\\n    /**\\n     * @dev Sets `value` as the allowance of `spender` over ``owner``'s tokens,\\n     * given ``owner``'s signed approval.\\n     *\\n     * IMPORTANT: The same issues {IERC20-approve} has related to transaction\\n     * ordering also apply here.\\n     *\\n     * Emits an {Approval} event.\\n     *\\n     * Requirements:\\n     *\\n     * - `spender` cannot be the zero address.\\n     * - `deadline` must be a timestamp in the future.\\n     * - `v`, `r` and `s` must be a valid `secp256k1` signature from `owner`\\n     * over the EIP712-formatted function arguments.\\n     * - the signature must use ``owner``'s current nonce (see {nonces}).\\n     *\\n     * For more information on the signature format, see the\\n     * https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612#specification[relevant EIP\\n     * section].\\n     *\\n     * CAUTION: See Security Considerations above.\\n     */\\n    function permit(\\n        address owner,\\n        address spender,\\n        uint256 value,\\n        uint256 deadline,\\n        uint8 v,\\n        bytes32 r,\\n        bytes32 s\\n    ) external;\\n\\n    /**\\n     * @dev Returns the current nonce for `owner`.

This contract extends\\n * the ERC20 standard. Any additional extensions included along it would affect the \\\"shares\\\" token represented by this\\n * contract and not the \\\"assets\\\" token which is an independent contract.\\n *\\n * [CAUTION]\\n * ====\\n * In empty (or nearly empty) ERC-4626 vaults, deposits are at high risk of being stolen through frontrunning\\n * with a \\\"donation\\\" to the vault that inflates the price of a share. This is variously known as a donation or inflation\\n * attack and is essentially a problem of slippage. Vault deployers can protect against this attack by making an initial\\n * deposit of a non-trivial amount of the asset, such that price manipulation becomes infeasible. Withdrawals may\\n * similarly be affected by slippage. Users can protect against this attack as well as unexpected slippage in general by\\n * verifying the amount received is as expected, using a wrapper that performs these checks such as\\n * https://github.com/fei-protocol/ERC4626#erc4626router-and-base[ERC4626Router].\\n *\\n * Since v4.9, this implementation uses virtual assets and shares to mitigate that risk. The `_decimalsOffset()`\\n * corresponds to an offset in the decimal representation between the underlying asset's decimals and the vault\\n * decimals. This offset also determines the rate of virtual shares to virtual assets in the vault, which itself\\n * determines the initial exchange rate. While not fully preventing the attack, analysis shows that the default offset\\n * (0) makes it non-profitable, as a result of the value being captured by the virtual shares (out of the attacker's\\n * donation) matching the attacker's expected gains. With a larger offset, the attack becomes orders of magnitude more\\n * expensive than it is profitable. More details about the underlying math can be found\\n * xref:erc4626.adoc#inflation-attack[here].\\n *\\n * The drawback of this approach is that the virtual shares do capture (a very small) part of the value being accrued\\n * to the vault. Also, if the vault experiences losses, the users try to exit the vault, the virtual shares and assets\\n * will cause the first user to exit to experience reduced losses in detriment to the last users that will experience\\n * bigger losses. Developers willing to revert back to the pre-v4.9 behavior just need to override the\\n * `_convertToShares` and `_convertToAssets` functions.\\n *\\n * To learn more, check out our xref:ROOT:erc4626.adoc[ERC-4626 guide].\\n * ====\\n */\\nabstract contract ERC4626 is ERC20, IERC4626 {\\n    using Math for uint256;\\n\\n    IERC20 private _asset;\\n    uint8 private _underlyingDecimals;\\n\\n    /**\\n     * @dev Attempted to deposit more assets than the max amount for `receiver`.\\n     */\\n    error ERC4626ExceededMaxDeposit(address receiver, uint256 assets, uint256 max);\\n\\n    /**\\n     * @dev Attempted to mint more shares than the max amount for `receiver`.\\n     */\\n    error ERC4626ExceededMaxMint(address receiver, uint256 shares, uint256 max);\\n\\n    /**\\n     * @dev Attempted to withdraw more assets than the max amount for `receiver`.\\n     */\\n    error ERC4626ExceededMaxWithdraw(address owner, uint256 assets, uint256 max);\\n\\n    /**\\n     * @dev Attempted to redeem more shares than the max amount for `receiver`.\\n     */\\n    error ERC4626ExceededMaxRedeem(address owner, uint256 shares, uint256 max);\\n\\n    /**\\n     * @dev Set the underlying asset contract.
