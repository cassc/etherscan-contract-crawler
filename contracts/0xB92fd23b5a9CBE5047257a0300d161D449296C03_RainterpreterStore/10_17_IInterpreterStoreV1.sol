/// expressions. The store is responsible for ensuring that applying these state
/// changes is safe from key collisions with calls to `set` from different
/// `msg.sender` callers. I.e. it MUST NOT be possible for a caller to modify the
/// state changes associated with some other caller.
///
/// The store defines the shape of its own state changes, which is opaque to the
/// calling contract. For example, some store may treat the list of state changes
/// as a pairwise key/value set, and some other store may treat it as a literal
/// list to be stored as-is.
///
/// Each interpreter decides for itself which store to use based on the
/// compatibility of its own opcodes.
///
/// The store MUST assume the state changes have been corrupted by the calling
/// contract due to bugs or malicious intent, and enforce state isolation between
/// callers despite arbitrarily invalid state changes. The store MUST revert if
/// it can detect invalid state changes, such as a key/value list having an odd
/// number of items, but this MAY NOT be possible if the corruption is
/// undetectable.
