This object allows you to modify all of them at once, by simply modifying the scalar multiplier.\\n *\\n * I.e. a regular mapping represents values like this:\\n * value = mapping[id]\\n *\\n * And a scalable mapping represents values like this:\\n * value = mapping[id] * scalar\\n *\\n * This reduces the number of computations needed for modifying the balances of N users from O(n) to O(1).\\n\\n * Note: Notice how users are tracked by a generic bytes32 id instead of an address.

They can be anything, for example a pool id, an account id, etc.\\n *\\n * *********************\\n * Conceptual Examples\\n * *********************\\n *\\n * 1) Socialization of collateral during a liquidation.\\n *\\n * Scalable mappings are very useful for \\\"socialization\\\" of collateral, that is, the re-distribution of collateral when an account is liquidated. Suppose 1000 ETH are liquidated, and would need to be distributed amongst 1000 depositors. With a regular mapping, every depositor's balance would have to be modified in a loop that iterates through every single one of them. With a scalable mapping, the scalar would simply need to be incremented so that the total value of the mapping increases by 1000 ETH.\\n *\\n * 2) Socialization of debt during a liquidation.\\n *\\n * Similar to the socialization of collateral during a liquidation, the debt of the position that is being liquidated can be re-allocated using a scalable mapping with a single action.
