However, there are unique improvements\\n * and new features, specifically unbonding, as inspired by LP bonding on Osmosis.\\n * Unbonding allows the contract to guarantee deposits for a certain amount of time,\\n * increasing predictability and stickiness of TVL for Cellars.\\n *\\n * *********************************** Funding Flow ***********************************\\n *\\n * 1) The contract owner calls 'notifyRewardAmount' to specify an initial schedule of rewards\\n *    The contract should hold enough the distribution token to fund the\\n *    specified reward schedule, where the length of the reward schedule is defined by\\n *    epochDuration. This duration can also be changed by the owner, and any change will apply\\n *    to future calls to 'notifyRewardAmount' (but will not affect active schedules).\\n * 2) At a future time, the contract owner may call 'notifyRewardAmount' again to extend the\\n *    staking program with new rewards. These new schedules may distribute more or less\\n *    rewards than previous epochs. If a previous epoch is not finished, any leftover rewards\\n *    get rolled into the new schedule, increasing the reward rate. Reward schedules always\\n *    end exactly 'epochDuration' seconds from the most recent time 'notifyRewardAmount' has been\\n *    called.\\n *\\n * ********************************* Staking Lifecycle ********************************\\n *\\n * 1) A user may deposit a certain amount of tokens to stake, and is required to lock\\n *    those tokens for a specified amount of time. There are three locking options:\\n *    one day, one week, or one month. Longer locking times receive larger 'boosts',\\n *    that the deposit will receive a larger proportional amount of shares. A user\\n *    may not unstake until they choose to unbond, and time defined by the lock has\\n *    elapsed during unbonding.\\n * 2) When a user wishes to withdraw, they must first \\\"unbond\\\" their stake, which starts\\n *    a timer equivalent to the lock time. They still receive their rewards during this\\n *    time, but forfeit any locktime boosts. A user may cancel the unbonding period at any\\n *    time to regain their boosts, which will set the unbonding timer back to 0.\\n * 2) Once the lock has elapsed, a user may unstake their deposit, either partially\\n *    or in full. The user will continue to receive the same 'boosted' amount of rewards\\n *    until they unstake. The user may unstake all of their deposits at once, as long\\n *    as all of the lock times have elapsed. When unstaking, the user will also receive\\n *    all eligible rewards for all deposited stakes, which accumulate linearly.\\n * 3) At any time, a user may claim their available rewards for their deposits. Rewards\\n *    accumulate linearly and can be claimed at any time, whether or not the lock has\\n *    for a given deposit has expired. The user can claim rewards for a specific deposit,\\n *    or may choose to collect all eligible rewards at once.\\n *\\n * ************************************ Accounting ************************************\\n *\\n * The contract uses an accounting mechanism based on the 'rewardPerToken' model,\\n * originated by the Synthetix staking rewards contract. First, token deposits are accounted\\n * for, with synthetic \\\"boosted\\\" amounts used for reward calculations. As time passes,\\n * rewardPerToken continues to accumulate, whereas the value of 'rewardPerToken' will match\\n * the reward due to a single token deposited before the first ever rewards were scheduled.\\n *\\n * At each accounting checkpoint, rewardPerToken will be recalculated, and every time an\\n * existing stake is 'touched', this value is used to calculate earned rewards for that\\n * stake. Each stake tracks a 'rewardPerTokenPaid' value, which represents the 'rewardPerToken'\\n * value the last time the stake calculated \\\"earned\\\" rewards. Every recalculation pays the difference.\\n * This ensures no earning is double-counted. When a new stake is deposited, its\\n * initial 'rewardPerTokenPaid' is set to the current 'rewardPerToken' in the contract,\\n * ensuring it will not receive any rewards emitted during the period before deposit.\\n *\\n * The following example applies to a given epoch of 100 seconds, with a reward rate\\n * of 100 tokens per second:\\n *\\n * a) User 1 deposits a stake of 50 before the epoch begins\\n * b) User 2 deposits a stake of 20 at second 20 of the epoch\\n * c) User 3 deposits a stake of 100 at second 50 of the epoch\\n *\\n * In this case,\\n *\\n * a) At second 20, before User 2's deposit, rewardPerToken will be 40\\n *     (2000 total tokens emitted over 20 seconds / 50 staked).\\n * b) At second 50, before User 3's deposit, rewardPerToken will be 82.857\\n *     (previous 40 + 3000 tokens emitted over 30 seconds / 70 staked == 42.857)\\n * c) At second 100, when the period is over, rewardPerToken will be 112.267\\n *     (previous 82.857 + 5000 tokens emitted over 50 seconds / 170 staked == 29.41)\\n *\\n *\\n * Then, each user will receive rewards proportional to the their number of tokens. At second 100:\\n * a) User 1 will receive 50 * 112.267 = 5613.35 rewards\\n * b) User 2 will receive 20 * (112.267 - 40) = 1445.34\\n *       (40 is deducted because it was the current rewardPerToken value on deposit)\\n * c) User 3 will receive 100 * (112.267 - 82.857) = 2941\\n *       (82.857 is deducted because it was the current rewardPerToken value on deposit)\\n *\\n * Depending on deposit times, this accumulation may take place over multiple\\n * reward periods, and the total rewards earned is simply the sum of rewards earned for\\n * each period. A user may also have multiple discrete deposits, which are all\\n * accounted for separately due to timelocks and locking boosts. Therefore,\\n * a user's total earned rewards are a function of their rewards across\\n * the proportional tokens deposited, across different ranges of rewardPerToken.\\n *\\n * Reward accounting takes place before every operation which may change\\n * accounting calculations (minting of new shares on staking, burning of\\n * shares on unstaking, or claiming, which decrements eligible rewards).\\n * This is gas-intensive but unavoidable, since retroactive accounting\\n * based on previous proportionate shares would require a prohibitive\\n * amount of storage of historical state. On every accounting run, there\\n * are a number of safety checks to ensure that all reward tokens are\\n * accounted for and that no accounting time periods have been missed.\\n *\\n */\\ncontract CellarStaking is ICellarStaking, Ownable {\\n    using SafeTransferLib for ERC20;\\n\\n    // ============================================ STATE ==============================================\\n\\n    // ============== Constants ==============\\n\\n    uint256 public constant ONE = 1e18;\\n    uint256 public constant ONE_DAY = 60 * 60 * 24;\\n    uint256 public constant ONE_WEEK = ONE_DAY * 7;\\n    uint256 public constant TWO_WEEKS = ONE_WEEK * 2;\\n\\n    uint256 public immutable SHORT_BOOST;\\n    uint256 public immutable MEDIUM_BOOST;\\n    uint256 public immutable LONG_BOOST;\\n\\n    uint256 public immutable SHORT_BOOST_TIME;\\n    uint256 public immutable MEDIUM_BOOST_TIME;\\n    uint256 public immutable LONG_BOOST_TIME;\\n\\n    // ============ Global State =============\\n\\n    ERC20 public immutable override stakingToken;\\n    ERC20 public immutable override distributionToken;\\n    uint256 public override currentEpochDuration;\\n    uint256 public override nextEpochDuration;\\n    uint256 public override rewardsReady;\\n\\n    uint256 public override minimumDeposit;\\n    uint256 public override endTimestamp;\\n    uint256 public override totalDeposits;\\n    uint256 public override totalDepositsWithBoost;\\n    uint256 public override rewardRate;\\n    uint256 public override rewardPerTokenStored;\\n\\n    uint256 private lastAccountingTimestamp = block.timestamp;\\n\\n    /// @notice Emergency states in case of contract malfunction.\\n    bool public override paused;\\n    bool public override ended;\\n    bool public override claimable;\\n\\n    // ============= User State ==============\\n\\n    /// @notice user => all user's staking positions\\n    mapping(address => UserStake[]) public stakes;\\n\\n    // ========================================== CONSTRUCTOR ===========================================\\n\\n    /**\\n     * @param _owner                The owner of the staking contract - will immediately receive ownership.\\n     * @param _stakingToken         The token users will deposit in order to stake.\\n     * @param _distributionToken    The token the staking contract will distribute as rewards.\\n     * @param _epochDuration        The length of a reward schedule.\\n     * @param shortBoost            The boost multiplier for the short unbonding time.\\n     * @param mediumBoost           The boost multiplier for the medium unbonding time.\\n     * @param longBoost             The boost multiplier for the long unbonding time.\\n     * @param shortBoostTime        The short unbonding time.\\n     * @param mediumBoostTime       The medium unbonding time.\\n     * @param longBoostTime         The long unbonding time.\\n     */\\n    constructor(\\n        address _owner,\\n        ERC20 _stakingToken,\\n        ERC20 _distributionToken,\\n        uint256 _epochDuration,\\n        uint256 shortBoost,\\n        uint256 mediumBoost,\\n        uint256 longBoost,\\n        uint256 shortBoostTime,\\n        uint256 mediumBoostTime,\\n        uint256 longBoostTime\\n    ) {\\n        stakingToken = _stakingToken;\\n        distributionToken = _distributionToken;\\n        nextEpochDuration = _epochDuration;\\n\\n        SHORT_BOOST = shortBoost;\\n        MEDIUM_BOOST = mediumBoost;\\n        LONG_BOOST = longBoost;\\n\\n        SHORT_BOOST_TIME = shortBoostTime;\\n        MEDIUM_BOOST_TIME = mediumBoostTime;\\n        LONG_BOOST_TIME = longBoostTime;\\n\\n        transferOwnership(_owner);\\n    }\\n\\n    // ======================================= STAKING OPERATIONS =======================================\\n\\n    /**\\n     * @notice  Make a new deposit into the staking contract.
