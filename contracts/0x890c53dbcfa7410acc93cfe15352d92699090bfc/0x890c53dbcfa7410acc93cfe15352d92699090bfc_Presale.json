Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an\r\n * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer\r\n * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.\r\n *\r\n * The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be\r\n * reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each \"step\" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in\r\n * case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.\r\n *\r\n * For example:\r\n *\r\n * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]\r\n * ```\r\n * contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {\r\n *     function initialize() initializer public {\r\n *         __ERC20_init(\"MyToken\", \"MTK\");\r\n *     }\r\n * }\r\n * contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {\r\n *     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {\r\n *         __ERC20Permit_init(\"MyToken\");\r\n *     }\r\n * }\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as\r\n * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.\r\n *\r\n * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure\r\n * that all initializers are idempotent.
