This contract manages the ability to create NFT-backed\\n * peer-to-peer loans of type Fixed (agreed to be a fixed-repayment loan) where the borrower pays the\\n * maximumRepaymentAmount regardless of whether they repay early or not.\\n *\\n * There are two ways to commence an NFT-backed loan:\\n *\\n * a. The borrower accepts a lender's offer by calling `acceptOffer`.\\n *   1. the borrower calls nftContract.approveAll(NFTfi), approving the NFTfi contract to move their NFT's on their\\n * be1alf.\\n *   2. the lender calls erc20Contract.approve(NFTfi), allowing NFTfi to move the lender's ERC20 tokens on their\\n * behalf.\\n *   3. the lender signs an off-chain message, proposing its offer terms.\\n *   4. the borrower calls `acceptOffer` to accept these terms and enter into the loan. The NFT is stored in\\n * the contract, the borrower receives the loan principal in the specified ERC20 currency, the lender receives an\\n * NFTfi promissory note (in ERC721 form) that represents the rights to either the principal-plus-interest, or the\\n * underlying NFT collateral if the borrower does not pay back in time, and the borrower receives obligation receipt\\n * (in ERC721 form) that gives them the right to pay back the loan and get the collateral back.\\n *\\n * b. The lender accepts a borrowe's binding terms by calling `acceptListing`.\\n *   1. the borrower calls nftContract.approveAll(NFTfi), approving the NFTfi contract to move their NFT's on their\\n * be1alf.\\n *   2. the lender calls erc20Contract.approve(NFTfi), allowing NFTfi to move the lender's ERC20 tokens on their\\n * behalf.\\n *   3. the borrower signs an off-chain message, proposing its binding terms.\\n *   4. the lender calls `acceptListing` with an offer matching the binding terms and enter into the loan. The NFT is\\n * stored in the contract, the borrower receives the loan principal in the specified ERC20 currency, the lender\\n * receives an NFTfi promissory note (in ERC721 form) that represents the rights to either the principal-plus-interest,\\n * or the underlying NFT collateral if the borrower does not pay back in time, and the borrower receives obligation\\n * receipt (in ERC721 form) that gives them the right to pay back the loan and get the collateral back.\\n *\\n * The lender can freely transfer and trade this ERC721 promissory note as they wish, with the knowledge that\\n * transferring the ERC721 promissory note tranfsers the rights to principal-plus-interest and/or collateral, and that\\n * they will no longer have a claim on the loan. The ERC721 promissory note itself represents that claim.\\n *\\n * The borrower can freely transfer and trade this ERC721 obligaiton receipt as they wish, with the knowledge that\\n * transferring the ERC721 obligaiton receipt tranfsers the rights right to pay back the loan and get the collateral\\n * back.\\n *\\n *\\n * A loan may end in one of two ways:\\n * - First, a borrower may call NFTfi.payBackLoan() and pay back the loan plus interest at any time, in which case they\\n * receive their NFT back in the same transaction.\\n * - Second, if the loan's duration has passed and the loan has not been paid back yet, a lender can call\\n * NFTfi.liquidateOverdueLoan(), in which case they receive the underlying NFT collateral and forfeit the rights to the\\n * principal-plus-interest, which the borrower now keeps.\\n */\\ncontract DirectLoanFixedOffer is DirectLoanBaseMinimal {\\n    /* ********** */\\n    /* DATA TYPES */\\n    /* ********** */\\n\\n    bytes32 public constant LOAN_TYPE = bytes32(\\\"DIRECT_LOAN_FIXED_OFFER\\\");\\n\\n    /* *********** */\\n    /* CONSTRUCTOR */\\n    /* *********** */\\n\\n    /**\\n     * @dev Sets `hub` and permitted erc20-s\\n     *\\n     * @param _admin - Initial admin of this contract.\\n     * @param  _nftfiHub - NFTfiHub address\\n     * @param  _permittedErc20s - list of permitted ERC20 token contract addresses\\n     */\\n    constructor(\\n        address _admin,\\n        address _nftfiHub,\\n        address[] memory _permittedErc20s\\n    )\\n        DirectLoanBaseMinimal(\\n            _admin,\\n            _nftfiHub,\\n            ContractKeys.getIdFromStringKey(\\\"DIRECT_LOAN_COORDINATOR\\\"),\\n            _permittedErc20s\\n        )\\n    {\\n        // solhint-disable-previous-line no-empty-blocks\\n    }\\n\\n    /* ********* */\\n    /* FUNCTIONS */\\n    /* ********* */\\n\\n    /**\\n     * @notice This function is called by the borrower when accepting a lender's offer to begin a loan.\\n     *\\n     * @param _offer - The offer made by the lender.\\n     * @param _signature - The components of the lender's signature.\\n     * @param _borrowerSettings - Some extra parameters that the borrower needs to set when accepting an offer.\\n     */\\n    function acceptOffer(\\n        Offer memory _offer,\\n        Signature memory _signature,\\n        BorrowerSettings memory _borrowerSettings\\n    ) external whenNotPaused nonReentrant {\\n        address nftWrapper = _getWrapper(_offer.nftCollateralContract);\\n        _loanSanityChecks(_offer, nftWrapper);\\n        _loanSanityChecksOffer(_offer);\\n        _acceptOffer(\\n            LOAN_TYPE,\\n            _setupLoanTerms(_offer, nftWrapper),\\n            _setupLoanExtras(_borrowerSettings.revenueSharePartner, _borrowerSettings.referralFeeInBasisPoints),\\n            _offer,\\n            _signature\\n        );\\n    }\\n\\n    /* ******************* */\\n    /* READ-ONLY FUNCTIONS */\\n    /* ******************* */\\n\\n    /**\\n     * @notice This function can be used to view the current quantity of the ERC20 currency used in the specified loan\\n     * required by the borrower to repay their loan, measured in the smallest unit of the ERC20 currency.\\n     *\\n     * @param _loanId  A unique identifier for this particular loan, sourced from the Loan Coordinator.\\n     *\\n     * @return The amount of the specified ERC20 currency required to pay back this loan, measured in the smallest unit\\n     * of the specified ERC20 currency.\\n     */\\n    function getPayoffAmount(uint32 _loanId) external view override returns (uint256) {\\n        LoanTerms storage loan = loanIdToLoan[_loanId];\\n        return loan.maximumRepaymentAmount;\\n    }\\n\\n    /* ****************** */\\n    /* INTERNAL FUNCTIONS */\\n    /* ****************** */\\n\\n    /**\\n     * @notice This function is called by the borrower when accepting a lender's offer to begin a loan.\\n     *\\n     * @param _loanType - The loan type being created.\\n     * @param _loanTerms - The main Loan Terms struct.
