 *
 * Support for ERC20 is included in this contract, as specified by the EIP: both
 * the ERC777 and ERC20 interfaces can be safely used when interacting with it.
 * Both `IERC777.Sent` and `IERC20.Transfer` events are emitted on token
 * movements.
 *
 * Additionally, the `granularity` value is hard-coded to `1`, meaning that there
 * are no special restrictions in the amount of tokens that created, moved, or
 * destroyed. This makes integration with ERC20 applications seamless.
