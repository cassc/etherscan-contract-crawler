/**
 * @dev A sequence of items with the ability to efficiently push and pop items (i.e. insert and remove) on both ends of
 * the sequence (called front and back). Among other access patterns, it can be used to implement efficient LIFO and
 * FIFO queues. Storage use is optimized, and all operations are O(1) constant time. This includes {clear}, given that
 * the existing queue contents are left in storage.
 *
 * The struct is called `Bytes32Deque`. Other types can be cast to and from `bytes32`. This data structure can only be
 * used in storage, and not in memory.
 * ```
 * DoubleEndedQueue.Bytes32Deque queue;
