/// @notice Mimics Open Zeppelin Ownable so that a contract can be BOTH Ownable
/// AND Adminable. Centralised offchain marketplaces often expect an owner to
/// be present to manage NFT content on the platform. However it is not clear
/// what criteria the marketplace uses to determine whether a contract
/// implements Ownable, and the criteria may change over time even if we did
/// know it. It's also not necessarily easy or possible to interface with
/// centralised marketplaces using multisig wallets such as gnosis. For that
/// reason we want an onchain admin with a relatively cold multisig separate
/// from the hot wallet doing offchain signing, etc.
/// If there is ever an issue with the owner (e.g. it is hacked/stolen/lost)
/// then the admin MUST be able to recover the owner by setting it directly to
/// a known good uncompromised wallet.
